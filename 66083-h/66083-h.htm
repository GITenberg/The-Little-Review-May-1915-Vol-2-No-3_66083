What We Are Fighting For
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Margaret C. Anderson</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> have been much criticised for an article on Gabrilowitsch in the last
issue. I have been told rather violently that I didn’t know what I
was talking about; that to say Gabrilowitsch had stood still artistically or
that the music critics were deaf because they didn’t like Scriabin’s <em>Prometheus</em>
was simply to brand <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> again as the kind of magazine
which delights in any sort of snap-shot judgment that may sound startling
or “new.” But the fact of the matter is this: if <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
is ready to stand behind any of its judgments (and it is very ready), I can
think of nothing that has appeared which I will so eagerly and convincingly
defend as that article on Gabrilowitsch or my remark that <em>Prometheus</em> was
extraordinarily beautiful. I can “prove” the first in at least three ways, and
I have some one in mind (a Russian) who will write a poem on his reactions
to <em>Prometheus</em> that will make you all wish you had imaginations too.
</p>

<p>
But this is not important. It merely leads me to an announcement of
a series of articles—a sort of campaign—that we have been planning for
the last two months. If we are to prove that we have a real “function” it
will be this of depreciating values that have ceased to be important and
appreciating new ones that have emerged—or, as I should say, values that
<em>are about to become unimportant</em> and those that <em>are about to emerge</em>. In
view of such a function I am quite willing to agree with my critics that the
Gabrilowitsch article wasn’t worth anything: it merely stated things that
are already quite well known, and a magazine that means to announce transvaluations
before the approximate ten-year period during which even the
uninspired come to accept them has no business to concern itself with mere
restatements. Of course the most frequent criticism brought against <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> is that it goes to artistic and emotional and intellectual
lengths no well-balanced person wants to go. I only wish this were true:
I mean, we haven’t gone any real <em>lengths</em>—and that is just what’s the matter
with us. We have made statements that seemed fearfully radical and new
to a lot of people who don’t know what’s going on in the world; and I’m
afraid we have listened to these people and tried to “convert” them. We
have wanted to convince everybody—particularly those who seemed to need
it most. And there is nothing more fatal: because what everybody thinks
doesn’t matter; what a few think matters tremendously. I was brought up
with a shock the other day, at an editors’ “meeting,” when Lucien Cary said
that though <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> had one of the requisites of the ideal magazine,—youth,—it
had the wrong kind of youth: the kind that has not yet
caught up instead of the kind that has gone ahead. After trying to face that
squarely for five awful minutes I was forced to decide that he was right. I
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
mean in this way: I know the quality of our youth is all right, just as I
know that people who write true things and live false ones are all wrong;
but the wisdom of it is quite another matter. And one of our big mistakes
has been a hope that preaching will help.
</p>

<p>
There’s nothing pompous in saying that the thoughts of only a few
people matter. This has always been so and always will be. Every new
valuation has come about just that way—championed by a group and then
endorsed by a majority long after it has ceased to matter much. But for a
magazine that means to count—well, I can’t decide whether our predicament
of having got into a sort of Billy Sunday slump is humorous or very sad.
Hereafter we shall pretend that there are no impossibilists in our audience.
</p>

<p>
But the announcement: In each of the future issues of <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span>, beginning with June if possible, we shall have a special article
attacking current fallacies in the arts or in life—getting down to the foundations.
Each one will be written by a person who knows thoroughly what
he is talking about, and each will be “true and memorable,” to use Will
Comfort’s good phrase. For instance, suppose we begin with the modern
theatre. It will be interesting to find why Clayton Hamilton calls a play
as false, as distorted, as unwholesome and demoralizing as <em>The Shadow</em> a
great drama, and why Percy Hammond, who is looked upon even by some
of the discerning as a critic worthy to be trusted in the work of spreading
ideas, should have nothing but superlatives for the same outrage. (To do
him justice, Mr. Hammond did modify his praise with a single naive sentence:
“I could find some flaws in <em>The Shadow</em>”; and then, to put his other
foot in, “but the playing glossed them over until they were forgivable”—which
is precisely the crime and tragedy of such productions). This type of
intellectual blundering is apparent everywhere among the critics of literature,
of music, of art, of the drama, and among the strangest of all human
creatures—the historians (“men who reserve their judgments for a hundred
years”) and the philosophers (men whose judgments are good for everything
except to live by). If you happen to be equipped with knowledge
of the intricate hypocrisies of the music schools, or the way the newspapers
treat a competent art critic, or the methods of a manager in making a good
play a bad one, or how dissatisfied the railway employees really are
or ought to be—send us an article on the subject. The conditions of
acceptance are these: You must know English prose; you must write it
as though you are talking instead of writing; you must say quite frankly
and in detail the things you would not be allowed to say in the prostituted,
subsidized, or uninteresting magazines; and you must be true. This begins
our warfare.

America’s Ignition
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Will Levington Comfort</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
... The quickened pulse of America did not appear with the outbreak
of war. It came with the winter cold, like all revival spirit—a strange
and fervent heat, breaking down the old, vitalizing the new everywhere.
No one doubts now—no one who can tear his eyes from the ground even
for a little—doubts now that the new social order is upon us.
</p>

<p>
America, in opening her breasts to the agony of Europe, in her giving
of solids and sympathy, has stumbled upon the ancient and perfect formula
for receiving the greater good. In forgetting herself a little, her own
human spirit has been ignited.
</p>

<p>
If someone announced that there lived in the Quattor Islands a man
who knew the exact way to bring into the world, not only the spirit, but the
action of <em>brotherhood</em> and <em>fatherland</em>, there would be some call for maps
and steamship passages. If the Quattor Islands were not already on the
maps, they would presently appear, but not before the earliest pilgrims
had set out. And if someone should add that all expression of the arts
so far in the world is wumbled and imperfect compared to that which is
about to be, if a certain formula is followed; and that this man in the Quattor
group has the formula—many more would start on the quest, or send
their most trusted secretaries.
</p>

<p>
And yet the truth and the way is all here, and has been uttered again
and again by every voice that has lifted itself above the common din.
</p>

<p>
The wise men carried gifts. You would expect to give something for
the secret. You might expect to be called upon to sell all you have and
give to the poor. You would not be surprised even if the magnetic Islander
said:
</p>

<p>
“It is not your frankincense and myrrh that I want, though I thank
you. That which I have is for you. I am more anxious for you to know
and live it, than you can be to have and hold it. But the mystery is that
it will not come to abide with you, while you are passionate for possession.
The passion to give to others must be established within you before you
can adequately receive—”
</p>

<p>
You are beginning to see how ancient is the gospel. It is old, older
than that. It belongs to the foundations. Personally and nationally, the law
works the same way. That which is true, is true in all its parts. There
is an adjustment by which that which is good for the whole is good for
the part; that which is good for the nation is good for the man; but each,
whole and part, nation and man, must have for the first thought not self-good
but the general good. One nation, so established in this conviction
that its actions are automatically founded upon the welfare of the world,
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
could bring about the true fatherland in a generation; and one human heart
so established begins to touch from the first moment the profound significances
of life.
</p>

<p>
Personally and nationally, this plain but tremendous concept is beginning
to manifest itself here in America. I do not write as a patriot. It
is not <em>my country</em> that is of interest, but humankind. America’s political
interests, her trade, all her localizations as a separate and bounded people,
are inimical to the new enthusiasm. The new social order cannot concern
itself as a country apart. American predatory instincts, her self-worship,
her attempt at neutrality while supplying explosives for the European
slaughter arenas, her deepening confinement in matter during the past fifty
years, have prepared her for the outright demoralization of war, just as
surely as Europe is meeting today the red harvest from such instincts and
activities. For action invariably follows the thought.
</p>

<p>
Yet the hearts of men in America are changing. I do not write as a
religionist, but as one very much of the world. For the hearts of men do
change, and it is only through such changes that the material stagnation
of a people can be relieved without deluges of blood.
</p>

<p>
The high hope is upon us. In being apart from war, America has
been enabled to see. One must always remove himself from the ruck to
see its movement. In the past six months, within these western shores, the
voices of true inspiration have been heard. From a literary standpoint alone,
this is the most significant fact since Emerson, Whitman, and Thoreau, took
pen in hand forgetting themselves a little while each day. There is a peculiar
strength upon American production of all kinds, as a result of this very act
of getting out from under European influence.
</p>

<p>
England and France and Germany are merely national voices now. The
voice of the partisan is but a weak treble against the basic rumble of war.
War is a confession, as suicide is a confession, as every act of blood and
rage is a confession, of the triumph of the animal in the human mind....
If you have received letters from friends in England or Germany or France
since the war; friends whom formerly you admired for their culture and
acumen, you have been struck by the dullness and misery of the communications,
the uncentered points of view, the incapacity of human vision in the
midst of the heaviness and blackness of life there; if, indeed, you have read
the recent newspapers and periodicals of these countries, you will require
no further proof of the fact—that a nation at war is an obscene nation,
its consciousness all driven down into the physical, its voice tonally imperfect
from hate and fear, its eyes open to red illusion and not to truth.
</p>

<p>
Even in America the voice of the nationalist is a part of the old and
the unclean. The new social order does not recognize the rights and desires
of any isolated people. Humankind is basically one in meaning, in aim and
in destiny. The difference of one nation from another in relation to the
sun’s rays, in character, country, environment, race, color and structure of
mind—these are primal values, the very values that will sum up into the
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
essential grandeur of the whole. Personally and nationally there are no
duplicates in the social scheme. The instruments of this magnificent orchestra
are of infinite diversity, but the harmony is one.
</p>

<p>
The spiritual source of all human achievement is already a harmonic
whole. That globe is complete. It is our business as men to make a pattern
of it in matter—to make the dream come true in flesh, each man and each
nation bringing his labor, which can only be bent into a fitting arc, by the
loss of the love of self.
</p>

<p>
It requires but a little vision to observe Nature at work upon this concept
in a thousand ways. She always seeks to preserve her balances. If
a certain plant, or bird, insect, beast, man or nation, rises by intrinsic force
and predation to dangerous increase, a destroying parasite is invariably
fostered within its shadow. In good time these two growths turn to rend
each other, a mutual cleansing. The Prussian war-office is a counter-growth
to British imperialism. That which survives will be humbler and wiser.
</p>

<p>
I saw in a doctor’s office in Canada the picture of an English bull-dog
standing large against the background of a British flag, and beneath was
this line:
</p>

<p>
“What we have, we’ll hold.”
</p>

<p>
I found that the picture had a national acceptance in the British colonies
and at Home. Yet a child stopping to think would have seen breakers
ahead for a nation so lost in material things, as thus to challenge the Fates....
There is a fairy-tale of a man building a great boat for the air.
It looked to win, and in the effrontery of achievement, he set forth to conquer
God. Just then a hornet stung him....
</p>

<p>
All this to suggest that the new dimension of life must come from America,
if it comes at all; and from this vantage-point, the reality is mightily
appearing—in the new poetry, in the new novels, in music, painting, and the
crafts. The generation just coming into its own, contains the builders whose
work is to follow the destroyers of war. They are not self-servers. They
do not believe in intellect. Their genius is <em>intuitionally</em> driven, not intellectually.
Just as steam has reached its final limitation as a force, and is
being superseded by electricity, the limitations of which <a id="corr-6"></a>have not been sensed
so far even by the most audacious, so the intellect as a producing medium,
has had its period—a period of style-worship, vanities of speech and action,
of self-service, or parading, of surface show and short-sightedness, without
parallel in the world.
</p>

<p>
For the intellect is a product of sunlight, its energy supplied by human
blood which dies. The new dimension comes from the fountain-head of
energy, and its first realization is the unity of all nature. The intellect is
as old as your body is; the giant that is awakening from sleep in the breasts
of the rising generation is immortal.
</p>

<p>
The thing that was called genius in the last generation met a destructive
force in the material world, almost as deadly and vindictive as that
encountered by Copernicus. The voices of the few heralds were scarcely
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
heard, but there is a battle-line of genius in the new generation, timed for
the great service years following the chaos of war. They will bring in the
liberation of religion from mammon; they will bring in the religion of work,
the equality of women, not on a mere suffrage matter alone, but in spirit
and truth; they will bring in their children un-accursed.

Remy De Gourmont
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">By Richard Aldington</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> work of Remy de Gourmont is known and read in all parts of the
civilized world. Yet he has not a large circulation and a purely commercial
writer would probably be disgusted at his profits, but he has an
influence, especially over the younger and more adventuresome spirits, which
few writers today possess. One can—or rather one could in the days before
the war—hardly pick up any French review without finding some reference
to his ideas or some criticism of his work. In Russia he appears to have
a more considerable reputation than anywhere else outside France. For,
though one sees criticism and translations of him even in languages like
Hungarian and Roumanian, it is in Russia alone that a word of praise from
Remy de Gourmont seems to make a man’s reputation. The English are
far slower in their international appreciations, and the Americans—quick
though they are to seize on new men—do not seem to have taken up
de Gourmont with much understanding. Mr. Ransome’s translation of
<em>Un Nuit au Luxembourg</em> was not received with either appreciation or enthusiasm
by English and American critics. And though a savant like Mr.
Havelock Ellis quotes from M. de Gourmont’s work, and has, I believe, a
great admiration for his personal intellectual qualities; though Mr. Sturge
Moore, in his book on Flaubert and Blake, quotes M. de Gourmont among
the great critics of France, it must be admitted that few English-speaking
critics have yet done him justice. I question if the larger public has heard
more of him than a vague rumour of his name.
</p>

<p>
It may be that he is thought too “high-brow.” I suppose every man
who gives his life up to the task of expressing his ideas, his character, and
his genius in a purely disinterested manner is liable to this criticism. But
there is so great a fascination in his work, whether it be criticism or fiction,
philosophic dialogue or prose poem, that whenever he gains a reader it is
not for an hour but for life. In America especially he should find readers,
for America, whatever artistic faults and drawbacks it may have, has not, as
England has, a “ring” of reviewers who unanimously “queer” any book
whose originality or genius is any menace to their own stick-in-the-mud
critical methods.
</p>

<p>
The Symbolist movement in France is now almost ancient history.
Unanimists, Futurists, Paroxysts, Fantasists, and all the other “ists” so
abundantly produced by this century now face the “ists” of Germany on
the battlefield. And while they are there fighting out by bodily force and
not by words the intellectual destinies of Europe we may perhaps consider
with free minds the Symbolist poets and authors who are now too old to
take the field for their country and can only sit at home “waiting for news.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
Some of the “children of Mallarmé” are dead; others are forgotten;
a few still remain. Maeterlinck, Vielé-Griffin, Jammes, and Remy de Gourmont
occur first to one’s mind as the best living representatives of the great
Symbolist school, and of these the subtlest, the most fascinating, the most
modern is Remy de Gourmont. Along with M. Anatole France, though
very different from him, Remy de Gourmont is an example of the tradition
of European culture. Less derivative than M. France, or perhaps deriving
from less familiar sources, with as great an irony and with a faith that
seems more sceptical than scepticism itself, he has extracted from the literature
of each country and century that part which helped him to develop
and train his own character. He presents in one person the manifold and
often conflicting opinions and ideas of modern culture. Reading his books
one sees that there is a mystical sort of beauty even in science and under his
pen mysticism itself appears almost as exact as a science.
</p>

<p>
I said just now that M. de Gourmont was an example of the tradition
of European culture, and since Paris, we are mostly agreed, is the centre
of European culture, and since Remy de Gourmont is a Parisian of Parisians,
we may count him, I think, as one of the best examples of Latin or
West European culture now living. I rather dwell upon this aspect of
Remy de Gourmont as the man of supreme culture since that quality has
so suddenly and so startlingly come into public discussion. It is extremely
difficult to say precisely what culture is; and a definition of culture naturally
varies with differences of race and temperaments. John Addington
Symonds, in his interesting and illuminating essay on this subject, defines
culture as “the raising of previously-educated faculties to their highest
potencies by the conscious effort of their possessors.” And it might be added
to this excellent definition that the feature of Latin or West European culture
which most distinguishes it from the culture of other countries is a
wideness of interest, a great general “cultivating” of all the faculties of the
mind and character as opposed to the extreme development of one single
faculty.
</p>

<p>
Remy de Gourmont is indeed so admirable an example of the type of
culture I have briefly indicated that it is difficult to think of any form of
intellectual activity which has not at one time or another received his attention.
He has been a founder of reviews—among them the famous <em>Mercure
de France</em>—and an editor of reviews. He has written prefaces for modern
authors and for ancient authors—both poets and prose-writers. As a literary
critic it is perhaps not too much to say that in his time and generation he
ranks as Sainte-Beuve did in his. Under his name will be found five volumes
of <em>Promenades Littéraires</em>, collections of essays dealing with the widest
possible range of literary subjects—from Petronius to Guillaume de
Machaut, from the Goliardi to the latest “roman passionnel.” His <em>Livres des
Masques</em> are one of the most considerable acquisitions to the criticism of
French literature during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. In
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
these two books will be found amazingly penetrating studies of men so
diverse as the de Goncourt brothers and Maeterlinck, while American
readers should be especially interested in his studies of the two Franco-American
poets, Stuart Merrill and Francis Vielé-Griffin. As an admirer
of Huysmans, M. Remy de Gourmont was naturally interested in the mystic,
Christian Latin poets. And the fruit of several years’ study of these authors
was that notable and unique book <em>Le Latin Mystique</em>. It is no exaggeration
to say that hardly anyone else could have made these writers interesting to
anyone but the specialist. One can almost imagine M. de Gourmont being
challenged to produce a book which would appeal not only to savants but
to the lover of general culture. This mystic Latin poetry had, until Huysmans’
day, been almost entirely neglected by students of beautiful things.
But Remy de Gourmont, treating the subject as a poet in love with poetry—not
as a pedant or a professor or a book-maker—has produced a work which
is at once a criticism and an anthology of the literature produced during
those thousand years which we ignorantly call the “Dark Ages.”
</p>

<p>
These investigations into an almost forgotten and strangely attractive
literature were not without effect upon his purely creative work. This effect
can be best seen in his <em>Litanies</em>, a series of curious and, verbally, extremely
beautiful prose-poems, full of assonances, of internal rhymes, of strange
symbols, of sonorous rhythms and of fantastic images. Again in his prose,
in works like <em>Le Pèlerin du Silence</em> and <em>D’un Pays Lointain</em>; in his poetry—especially
in <em>Les Saints du Paradis</em>—this influence is most marked.
</p>

<p>
In books like <em>La Physique de l’Amour</em>, <em>Le Chemin de Velours</em>, the series
of <em>Promenades Philosophiques</em> and <em>Epilogues</em>, we have an entirely different
kind of intellectual activity—lettered, it is true, but with that incisiveness
and clarity of style and thought which mark French prose as the finest in
the modern world. In these books problems of philosophy, of morals, of
everyday conduct and national and international affairs, problems of music,
of painting, of all the arts and sciences, are discussed with a brilliance and
an originality not always palatable to the gloomier and duller elements of
French society.
</p>

<p>
One must not ask for too clear a definition of M. de Gourmont’s philosophy.
He is just sufficient of a mystic to enjoy being misunderstood,
and of a nature so ironical that his most innocent-looking statements are
traps for the unwary. He is an individualist—true to his type of culture.
Perhaps if he were very closely questioned he would smile and say that
he belonged to the “tradition des libres esprits.”
</p>

<p>
In addition to these many works, of so diverse a character that they
might well be the result of the labours of several men rather than of one, he
has written several novels, one or two of which at their appearance were
the literary sensation of the hour; he has devoted much time to the study
of aesthetic questions and has published two or three volumes on the subject;
beyond all this he has produced a modern French rendering of Aucassin
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
and Nicolette, a translation from the Spanish and a couple of original
plays! And in his little flat on the rive gauche, not far from St. Sulpice,
among his books, he still writes every day words of encouragement for
anxious Paris, still finds time to observe and reflect and to let the rest of the
world know what is happening in France.

“Mother Jones” and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Margaret C. Anderson</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">other</span> Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn have been talking in Chicago
and I went to hear them both, expecting to be captivated by the
former and disappointed in the latter. But it turned out just the other way.
</p>

<p>
Mother Jones is all the things you have heard her to be—vigorous,
almost sprightly in her eighty-two years, witty, shrewd, kindly, hopeful of
great social changes, with snappy little blue eyes and a complexion like a
girl of eighteen and a tongue like an automatic revolver. You feel you’d
rather have her get after you with fire crackers, as she did to a man in
some Western hotel when she wanted to drive him out of town (and succeeded),
than to have her side against you in an argument. Right or wrong,
she would make you appear to be hopelessly wrong; and certainly on any
practical matter you would have a suspicion that she was right anyhow. She
is consistent and convincing. But there is one thing none of the magazine
articles has said about her: Mother Jones is a completely simple human
being, in the least flattering sense of the word. She suffers because men
are sent to jail and children are killed in strikes, and she spends every day
of her life working toward the prevention of these things. But she lives
on no more subtle plane of adjustments to a difficult universe. You can’t
associate her with any sort of intense personal struggle. If temperament
is the capacity to react, as I heard some one define it the other day, then
Mother Jones is as untemperamental a person as I’ve ever seen. She acts;
she doesn’t react at all. She has neither a complex nor an interesting mind;
she has a well-informed one. She has read a lot—chiefly history and economics.
She hasn’t read philosophy or psychology, I think. She hasn’t needed
to: her knowledge of psychology is that sweeping and rather crude kind that
comes with years of hard experience in which there has been little time for
observation. If you asked her to sympathize with a man who had killed
himself because he loved too greatly, I can rather hear her say that if men
would keep busy they wouldn’t have time for such notions. Life to her is
reduced to a matter of two antagonisms: the struggle between Capital and
Labor. Other things, such as Art, for instance,—well, she makes you feel
it’s a little impertinent to expect her to waste time like that; she is too busy
trying to outwit the “damned sewer rats,” as she calls Burns’ detectives or
other obstacles to peace and freedom. Mother Jones has a lot of effective
phrases of that sort; I think she wants to see if she can make you blanch
before she decides really to trust you; and then of course, as she says, “My
boys wouldn’t understand me if I talked nice and ladylike all the time.”
Underneath all this there is a charming old gentlewoman, full of delicate
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
courtesies that win for her the splendid chivalry of the rough men she spends
her life among.
</p>

<p>
The man who took me to see her made an unfortunate remark. He
told her that I wanted to write an article about her, and asked if she wouldn’t
tell me how she got started in her work. (I tried to stop him in time, but it
was no use.) She gave me one scornful look and then flashed at him:
“That’s a woman’s question. No man ever asks me such a fool thing, but
women always do. How do I know how I got started? I was always a
worker—that’s all.” Another of her simplifications is that there are two
kinds of people—those who work and those who don’t. She seemed to put
me with the latter, and it was my instinct from the first that she didn’t
approve of me. She just treated me politely, and it was rather awful. She
kept insisting that women know nothing about Labor—which is <em>almost</em>
quite true—and of course she didn’t neglect to mention her aversion for the
suffragists. But most of the time she told us stories, chuckling heartily whenever
she could say anything particularly explosive. She described her recent
trip to New York, and I remember her vivid account of a visit she made
the Colony Club. She said all the women came tripping in on high heels,
bent forward at an ominous angle that made her think of cats ready to
spring on a mouse. “I’ve got no time for such idiots,” she finished. “And
look at the crazy ones in this town, walking in a mayor’s parade and yelling
like wildcats instead of staying at home where they might be reading and
learning to educate their children.”
</p>

<p>
That night we went to hear her talk to an organization of painters and
found her irresistible. But she did little except entertain them—particularly
with stories in which she herself figured as the white-haired heroine,
wading across streams in water up to her waist to outwit the police, or
forcibly throwing a Burns detective out of her audience. The painters
shrieked with joy at that, and it really was good to hear. She had suspected
a certain man who had been going to her meetings, so one night she asked
him to leave. He refused, but she insisted. He said, “I won’t go and I’d
like to see anybody who can make me.” “Well,” she answered, “we’ll see
about that”; and she stepped down from the platform, took him by the
throat, held him so tightly “that his tongue stuck out,” and marched him out
of the hall. He didn’t bother her any more. These things, told in her
blunt, snappy way, are overwhelmingly funny—and stirring too. But what
you like most about her is her sudden falling into seriousness, and the way
she says, “Now, my boys, <em>stick together</em>. Solidarity is the only method by
which we can beat the system.”
</p>

<p>
Mother Jones has no patience with anarchism: “Don’t talk to me about
philosophies of an ideal society that will happen some time long after I’m
in my grave. What I’m after is to do something for my class while I’m
still alive. I believe in accomplishing things.” She has none of the anarchist’s
hatred of government; she merely wants our present system humanized.
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
And she has a lot of little prejudices about people and things: about
Bill Haywood, for instance, who “divides Labor against itself,” as she says—and
says untruly.
</p>

<p>
On the whole she is just what you would have expected—except that
she’s more amusing. There is absolutely nothing of the artist in her. She
is imaginative in the large way a child is; in fact Mother Jones is a child
in the sense a grown-up can’t be without losing a lot.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, “the girl agitator,” has an even more consistent
point of view than Mother Jones, and she has the advantage of being without
prejudices. Her face has more subtlety, more interest for the analyst,
than Mother Jones’s obvious compressed mouth and quick eyes; but it has
little of that stamp of multiple reactions which make Emma Goldman’s face
such a fascinating “subject.” There is a touch of Irish poetry in it—something
wistful and something stern.
</p>

<p>
Miss Flynn gave three talks—on Birth Control, on Violence in Relation
to the Labor Movement, and on Solidarity: Labor’s Road to Freedom—but
I could only hear the last one, which everyone said was the least interesting
of the three. There was only a handful of workers there, and she
was so informing that the place ought to have been crowded with all the
good people who think the I. W. W. is an organization of unintelligent
outcasts whose only competence lies in throwing hammers into printing
presses, etc., etc. Miss Flynn is more articulate than any I. W. W. I have
heard, and she is freer from the stock phrases that give so many of the
very earnest young workers in the movement something of pathos. I like
these I. W. W. people a lot. They are not only offering an efficient program
of labor; they are getting close to a workable philosophy of life. They are
even capable of a virtue no working-class organization is supposed to be
overburdened with: hardness of thought. As Miss Flynn said: “Don’t
pamper yourselves. It’s not a <em>sacrifice</em> to fight for your own freedom!” Of
course this group has its camp followers who do it no end of damage; but
then the Socialists have their “practical” fanatics who are so awfully practical
they always look at the trees instead of the forest, and the Anarchists
have their soulful members who yearn for martyrdom and blubber about the
duty of suffering for a cause. The best of the Industrial Workers are
neither visionless nor sentimental. They have no interest in being martyrs;
they are workers. Miss Flynn is of the best of these.

The Poetry Bookshop
</h2>

</div>

<p class="subt">
(<em>35 Devonshire Street, London</em>)
</p>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Amy Lowell</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> well remember the first time I went to the Poetry Bookshop. It was
in July, 1913. I had read of it in a stray number of <em>The Poetry Review</em>
that had drifted my way. The idea attracted me at once, and I determined
to have a look at it during the summer. There was something alluringly
crazy about anyone’s starting a bookshop for the sale of poetry alone.
Poetry is at once my trade and my religion. All decent poets worship their
art and slave at it, and I am no exception to the rule. But I have my
“afternoons out” with their temptations, and the greatest of these is a
bookshop. Here was the combination: a poetry bookshop. I turned to it as
inevitably as a magnet to the pole.
</p>

<p>
It was after a visit to one of those large and flourishing establishments
where every sort of book is sold that you do not want to read; where rows
and rows of the classics you wish you could read again for the first time
flaunt from the shelves in gaudy leather bindings, and a whole counter
labours to support the newest and dullest novels, and another is covered
with monographs which instruct you minutely as to how to grow fruit-trees,
catch salmon, handle golf clubs, or bicycle through the home counties. It
was in one of these “emporiums,” after the usual “We can get it for you,
Madam,” that I broke into open revolt and started off to The Poetry
Bookshop.
</p>

<p>
I knew it was somewhere near the British Museum. “Off Theobald’s
Road,” I told the taxi driver, and settled down to looking out of the window,
for London, whether on foot or driving, is a never-ending interest to me.
Theobald’s Road is one of those large, busy thoroughfares, which cut across
London in all directions, and off it, to the left in my case, we turned into a
quiet, rather run-down little street, Devonshire Street. A swinging sign
about half-way down it attracted me. It was shaped like a shield and blue,
if I remember rightly, and on it were painted three torches. All this was
determined as the taxi approached. That must be my place, I thought,
and it was.
</p>

<p>
We drew up at the door of a shop—unmistakably a shop, because it
had a big shopwindow. It did not need the name, “The Poetry Bookshop”
in excellently designed, big, black letters over the window, to tell me that
I had arrived.
</p>

<p>
I did not go in at once. I like to take my temptations gradually, nibbling
at them bit by bit and tasting, before gulping them down as full-fledged
crimes. I nibbled at that window. It was broad and high, and the books
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
were displayed in it in the singularly fascinating manner which American
booksellers jeer at and call “English window dressing.” All these books
were poetry, or about poetry; that is, of course, all the ones that were not
plays. There were long strips of ballads hanging down, like 18th century
broadsides, each one topped by a crude woodcut in glaring reds, and blues,
and yellows. The nibbling was so delightful that I collected quite a crowd
of street urchins about me, wondering what the lady was looking so long
into the window for, before I had done.
</p>

<p>
Then I went in, but even the window had not prepared me for the
shop inside. It was a room rather than a shop, for there was a smart fire
burning in the grate, and there were chairs, and settles, and a big table
covered with the latest publications. The walls were lined with shelves,
and under the window was a little ledge entirely filled with reviews from
all over the world. The familiar cover of <em>Poetry</em> made me feel quite at
home, but the eclecticism of the proprietor was at once evidenced by the
presence of <em>The Poetry Journal</em> and <em>Poet Lore</em>, periodicals of whose existence
I should not have expected him to be aware. There was also <em>The Poetry
Review</em>, from which I knew he had severed himself, so it was obvious that
the proprietor cared very much to be fair.
</p>

<p>
I turned to the shelves, and my surprise was even greater. There were
a lot of shelves, all round the room and even over the chimney-breast. Every
volume of poetry recently published was there. That I had expected, but
what I had not expected was that all the classics were there too. Not
bound into mausoleums, “handsome editions in handsome bindings, which
no gentleman’s library should be without,” but readable volumes, for the
reader who wants to read.
</p>

<p>
There was not a bit of glass in the shop, all was open and touchable.
Of course I touched, and opened, and browsed. There were French books,
too, and Italian. It goes without saying that the book I wanted was there.
I know I bought it, and others, and came out laden and happy.
</p>

<p>
I did not meet Mr. Monro on this first visit, and I do not now remember
exactly when I did meet him. My sojourns in the shop were many, and
at this distance have become confused. But I did meet him sometime, and
found an earnest, quiet gentleman, the very opposite from the crank. But
even at the first visit I had felt the bookshop to be not “crazy” at all, but
an answer to a very real need.
</p>

<p>
It has been my experience that people who really do things (in contradistinction
to talking about them) are very straightforward, sensible persons,
without sentimentalism in the pursuit of their ideal. Mr. Monro was exactly
this. He was spending his energy to give poetry the dignity and charm of
presentation it had lost at the hands of the commercial booksellers; he was
encouraging poets and allowing their books a chance; but he did not talk
ideals, nor dress like a combination of a fool and a wild animal. He was
too busy to pose, he was just “on the job.” And what “on the job” meant
and means is best told by giving the history of his enterprise.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
For some years Mr. Monro had lived abroad, in Switzerland and Italy.
But the nostalgia of home took possession of him, and he returned to
England. Shortly after his arrival The Poetry Society asked him to edit
a magazine for them, and he consented, and <em>The Poetry Review</em> began in
January, 1912. Mr. Monro not only edited the <em>Review</em>, but paid for it.
Now the Poetry Society, like all such bodies, is conservative, and Mr. Monro
is sown with the seeds of radicalism. So differences of policy began, and
at the end of a year, Mr. Monro seceded from <em>The Poetry Review</em> and
founded another review, <em>Poetry and Drama</em>, to be published quarterly.
</p>

<p>
But I am anticipating. While editing <em>The Poetry Review</em> Mr. Monro
conceived the idea of having a bookshop, which should be at once the office
of the review and its various publications, and a shop. An old house in
Devonshire Street was leased and everything “en train,” when Mr. Monro
found that the inevitable breach with The Poetry Society on matters of
policy was imminent. He announced in <em>The Poetry Review</em> the foundation
of a new magazine, a quarterly, and relinquished <em>The Poetry Review</em> into
other hands after having founded it and edited it for twelve months.
</p>

<p>
On January 8th, 1913, The Poetry Bookshop opened its doors to the
public, and the public, always caught by novelty, flocked in. Professor
Henry Newbolt gave the opening address. The first publication of the
Bookshop, <em>Georgian Poets</em>, an anthology of the work of Lascelles Abercrombie,
Rupert Brooke, W. H. Davies, Walter de la Mare, James Elroy
Flecker, Wilfred Wilson Gibson, D. H. Lawrence, John Masefield, James
Stephens, Harold Monro himself, and others, had already appeared. This
book has been extraordinarily successful, and, in two years, has gone through
ten editions.
</p>

<p>
Of course the book helped the bookshop, and the bookshop helped the
book. So delighted were the amusement hunters with the idea, that there
was some danger of the venture being swamped in the tide of fashion. But
Mr. Monro was too genuinely in earnest to be elated by his success, or depressed
when it calmed down to a normal interest. The bookshop pegged
away at its work and in March, 1913, the first number of <em>Poetry and Drama</em>
appeared. This little quarterly is indispensable to anyone wishing to keep
abreast with what is being done in poetry abroad. The articles on French
poetry by F. S. Flint alone are worth the cost of subscription. But <em>Poetry
and Drama</em> also publishes original poetry, critical reviews, and English,
French, Italian, and American chronicles. It is an interesting paper, and
if I easily see how it could be bettered, that only means that I am an enthusiastic
reader. Was anyone ever sincerely devoted to a paper without
feeling that with a grain of his advice it could still be improved?
</p>

<p>
Yet I have a sneaking feeling that Mr. Monro runs his paper better
than I should, better than any of us would. It requires a singularly unselfish
and dispassionate devotion to run a paper and have it favor all schools, and
criticise all cliques, equally. Nobody is quite pleased by that method, but
the public gets what it pays for, and I, for one, admire a man with this quality
of justice in him. <em>Poetry and Drama</em> ran until December of this year, when
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
it was suspended during the continuance of the war, and the lack of it is
so noticeable that it shows very well what a position it had already achieved.

The Poetry Bookshop publishes as well as sells. <em>Georgian Poetry</em> was
followed by <em>Anthologie des Imagistes</em>, <em>Poems</em> by John Alford, <em>Anthology of
Futurist Poetry</em>, and various small ventures such as <em>The Rhyme Sheet</em>
(the broadsides I have spoken of before), and a number of little chap books
called <em>Flying Fame Publications</em>, of which one I have seen, <em>Eve</em> by Ralph
Hodgson, is enchanting.

Many though Mr. Monro’s activities were, the house was too big for
them. So Mr. Monro fitted up some of the attic rooms as bedrooms, and
there his clientele of poets hailing from the country find a welcome and inexpensive
lodgings. Other rooms are used as reading rooms, for readings
are held every Tuesday and Thursday at 6 P. M. Sometimes the poets read
their own poems, sometimes other people read them. Verhaeren and Marinetti
have read there and many other poets, well-known and still unknown.
Mr. Monro invites those he desires, and as he runs his readings as he runs
his shop there is great and stimulating variety. The difficulty with this sort
of thing is the hangers-on, the horde of the sentimental of both sexes who
fasten upon an artistic endeavor and seriously hurt it. It is inevitable that
some of these parasites should drift into the readings, as I noticed on one
occasion that I was there. But time will weed them out, for such people
can never bear to realize that art is as hardworking as, say, stonecutting.
</p>

<p>
Since the war The Poetry Bookshop has been printing chap books, published
at sixpence. Among them are Maurice <a id="corr-13"></a>Hewlett’s <em>Singsongs of the
War</em>, <em>Antwerp</em> by Ford Maddox Hueffer, <em>The King’s Highway</em> by Henry
Newbolt, <em>The Old Ships</em> by James Elroy Flecker; and for unmartial relief,
<em>Spring Morning</em> by Frances Cornford, <em>Songs</em> by Edward Shanks, <em>The Contemplative
Quarry</em> by Anna Wickham, and <em>Children of Love</em> by Harold
Monro.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Monro is so stern in his idealism that, although a poet of
originality and feeling, he willingly minimizes his own production for the sake
of advancing poetry “en masse.” That is remarkable, and his enterprise
deserves all the success which the poets and the general public can give it.

<span class="firstchar">F</span><span class="postfirstchar">rom</span> the sea coast, from the bleak ravines of the hills that lift their
escarpments towards the sky that pours down pitiless threads of sunlight,
whirls over chill, clinging tentacles of rain, smashes hard buffets of huge
wind, sifts fine, quivering drifts of snow, thrashes with thunder and with
hail, uncurls its great sodden, flapping curtains before the gale—from the
marshlands, from the banks of slow rivers, from the still brown plateaus,
from the midst of steaming valleys, from the wide bays ringed with peaks,
a thousand cities reek into the sky. Through a million vents the smell of
cookery overflows. It rises upward day and night in strange, tragic black
rows of columns that glow and make the stars quiver and dance and darken
the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
Green rivers of corn, golden seas of wheat, white lakes of cotton meet
and fuse and inter-cross. Cattle string across in frightened procession:
multitudes on multitudes of horses, black, dun, grey, gallop away after
them, jarring the earth with their hoofs, beating up dust in heavy, fluffy
masses. Far away the sun lies still over broad patches of silence, sparsely
green, where an eagle hovers, or an antelope starts up, or a sly, half-starving
coyote is seen. The sun looks into yellow castles wedged in the cliff that
were old when the first explorers saw them, and on white bulging palaces
tinselled with marble and gold. The sun sees engines that rattle and cough,
black derricks that wave their arms in arcs aloft, crazy log cabins that topple
into the marsh. On every side are symbols of man’s desire, made with his
hands, hurried, glorious, sordid, tragic, clashing, insane; the sun looks and
does not understand but pours over them its heat and cold, and rain and
light, and lightning, always the same.
</p>

<p>
Immense machines are clamoring, rattling, battling, wheeling, screaming,
heaving, weaving. The wheels bound and groan and roar and waver
and snap—and go on as before. Between the cities, over plain and hill,
reel double paths of shining steel, where screaming locomotives pass like
black shuttles leaving great trails of smoke amid the wheat, the cattle, the
corn, the cotton, the sordid, hideous factory shafts, the fleet masses of
plunging and galloping stallions. Their forces are never spent or tired, for,
nervously above them, earth is laced and wired with crackling, chattering,
singing, whispering electricity. They fly from city to city, and the sky is
scribbled above them with childish grey gigantic scrawls, amid which the
sun wabbles and crawls. And over all shoot backward and forward words
that walk in air, and perhaps not long will the upper spaces be still, but soon
be filled with racing lines of strong black bird-machines bearing men on
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
their backs. Purring autos squawk and squeal, and spray and flutter, pale
flashes through the rack. Red, and black and yellow, the earth takes on
its coat of colors, from the struggle of a hundred million hands. It is a
palimpsest which no one reads or understands, which none has time to heed,
a loom-frame woven over with interspersed and tangled threads of which
the meaning is lost, from which the pattern hangs in shreds.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this, men struggle, surge, call out, fall choking, toil with backs
bent over the earth in black arcs. Crowds of them clatter, scramble, bustle,
push, and drift away. They creep, black, greasy masses, out of the earth
like ants; they swing out on great frozen blocks of steel or marble; they
saunter in some forgotten place; they yawn with the weariness of little towns.
Men, brown, black, yellow, pallid with fatigue, ruddy with gluttony, blotched
with disease, swarm and waver back and forth, east, west, south, north.
Crackling twigs of dripping forests mark their feet. Red wet furrowed
plains receive their pains. Grey, hungry factory towns bellow out through
steam-filled lungs for them each morning. Prison gates grate slowly, hospital
beds spread stateliness, insane asylums gibber through their windows.
They hustle and shovel, piling heaps of hovels, and now and then, as if in
mockery, some coppery tower that seems as if it would split its sky with
its majesty. They are in a great shallow sea, crinkling uneasily as if some
giant’s body were wallowing beneath. Some single impulse creaks through
them, pouring out its breath through the chimneys, scattering itself over
the fields, closing itself in behind the doors. It is one great, vague, inchoate
organism, scarcely feeling its pulse as yet, rolling in the belly of the world,
waiting its hour of birth. Earth is heaped about it; still it eats the earth
away, red covering after red covering, day on day. Now it half timidly
peeps out, now withdraws itself again. And ever the sky pours on it heat
and rain, and wind, and light, and lightning, and hail, shaping it, making it
less frail, more fit to wake and take its place in the world.
</p>

<p>
But over there, beyond the seas, where for years the war flags have
been stacked and furled, comes the crack of a pistol followed by faint cheers.
And now a smeary gloom appears; it seems to swell from out the earth; it
bulges in greenish folds above the horizon, and in its depths are flashes
from far-off guns. Suddenly from the heart of the cloud, which the cowed
world watches, holding its breath, come thick insensate hammer-blows
that split the core of earth asunder—the iron cannon unleashed for the dance
of death. Deeper and deeper the noise unrolls in a vast salute to the new
world from the old. It rises higher and higher, covering the sea with its
tumult, and filling the sky with gouts and spatters of crimson fire. North,
south, east, west, all the craters are emptying out their vitals on earth’s
breast. But the immensity of the troubled continent stirs not, nor gives to
the world the life that is restlessly heaving beneath it.
</p>

<p>
The centuries sit with hands on their knees, wearing on weary foreheads
their iron-crowned destinies. The sun glares, the rain spatters, the
thunder tramples his drums, the wind, rushing, hums its scorn; but the
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
being—the thing that will master all the ages—still hesitates to be born.
The great derricks, black and frozen, lift their arms in mid air; the locomotives
hoot and mutter in despair; the shuttles clatter and clamor and
hammer at the woof day and night. The black flight of priceless instants
reels and rebounds and shivers and crawls, while without the uproar of the
cannon calls like black seas battering the earth, grinding, sweeping, flickering,
pounding, pounding, pounding, in the increasing throes of birth. But
still the thing will not arrive. Still it refuses at the very gates of life.
America—America—blood-stained and torn with choked, convulsive sighs,
perhaps too late thou shalt arise, perhaps in vain shalt seek to rule the earth!

Some Imagist Poets
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">George Lane</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ome</span> months ago, in these pages, Mr. Witter Bynner pointed out that
“Imagism” was derived from a Japanese poetical form, the name
of which Mr. Bynner regretted that he had forgotten. This name is
“Hokku,” and undoubtedly the Japanese Hokku poetry was the model upon
which much of the work in the first Imagist Anthology was formed, notably
the contributions of Mr. Ezra Pound. There was Greek influence, too, in
that first collection. But the whole volume showed a remarkable desire
towards perfection and clarity of utterance, and a delicate perception of
beauty.
</p>

<p>
There were few poetry lovers who did not taste its fine, astringent
flavour, but its qualities were at once its faults. It was beautiful work,
but too tenuous ever to become a great art, said the objectors. It was incapable
of embracing many of the elements of life and poetry. The Imagists
must remain side-tracked, and therefore, clever though they were, they
could not be of real importance.
</p>

<p>
But it seems that Imagism was more virile, more capable of growth,
than was supposed. The jejune maledictions and assertions of their chief
spokesman, Mr. Pound, have done so much to make the group ridiculous that
it is with a feeling of surprise that we find this volume a great advance
upon its predecessor.
</p>

<p>
Here is the work of six poets, four of whom were represented in the
first anthology. In an interesting preface they state their poetical theories,
which are much the same as those printed so often in <em>Poetry</em>. But here the
tenets are soberly and sensibly presented, and the whole preface is dignified
and worthy of consideration. Clearly the Imagists are growing up.
</p>

<p>
It is hardly necessary to rehearse here the Imagist creed. It has been
discussed, with more or less hostility, in many reviews. But certainly, in
reading this preface, the hostility suddenly vanishes, and the reviewer finds
himself wondering if perhaps, after all, this movement is not one of most
unusual significance.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, these poets call themselves Imagists because their object is
to present an “image”; they believe “that poetry should render particulars
exactly and not deal in vague generalities, however magnificent and sonorous”;
<a id="corr-14"></a>they desire “to use the language of common speech,” and “to employ
always the <em>exact</em> word, not the nearly exact, nor the merely decorative word.”
They wish “to produce poetry that is hard and clear, never blurred nor
indefinite”; and, finally, they are convinced that “concentration is of the
very essence of poetry.”
</p>

<p>
Brave words, excellent aims and hard enough of attainment. Again,
these poets agree to allow absolute freedom of subject, and, with a little dig
at some of their contemporaries, they say, “It is not good art to write badly
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
about aeroplanes and automobiles; nor is it necessarily bad art to write well
about the past. We believe passionately in the artistic value of modern life,
but we wish to point out that there is nothing so uninspiring nor so old-fashioned
as an aeroplane of the year 1911.”
</p>

<p>
That is a wholesome point of view, but indeed the Imagists have hardly
erred on the side of too great a preoccupation with modern life. In fact
this volume is noteworthy as showing a more personal, a less literary, outlook
on life.
</p>

<p>
The first Imagist Anthology contained the work of ten poets. Some
were represented by a number of poems, some by only one. In this new
volume only four of those poets are represented. But what is remarkable
is that they are not all the one poem authors. On the contrary, Richard
Aldington and H. D. had more poems in the first anthology than anyone
else in the volume, yet here are Richard Aldington and H. D. subscribing
to an arrangement which gives each poet approximately the same amount
of space. “Also,” says the preface, “to avoid any appearance of precedence,
they (the poets included) have been put in alphabetical order.” So art is
to come before self-advertisement. Happy omen! With such ideals the
group should go far. Six young poets with so much talent, devotion, and
singleness of purpose, is a phenomenon to be noticed.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this is the key to the “differences of taste and judgment”
which have divorced these poets from the others of the first anthology.
They go on to say that “growing tendencies are forcing them along different
paths.” We can only guess at the tendencies, as the poems in this book
show them, and it is not our business to probe farther into a schism which
is touched upon so lightly and quietly in this admirable preface.
</p>

<p>
The six poets of this little anthology are: Richard Aldington, H. D.,
John Gould Fletcher, F. S. Flint, D. H. Lawrence, and Amy Lowell. It
is quite easy to see why “mutual artistic sympathy” binds these young
people together. But how extraordinarily individual they are, just the
same! From the exquisite, gem-like poems of H. D., to the organ music
of Amy Lowell in <em>The Bombardment</em>, with the graceful, tender, often
humorous work of Richard Aldington and the tragic earnestness of D. H.
Lawrence, set off by the rich imagination of John Gould Fletcher, and the
poetic realism, touched with a charming intimateness, of F. S. Flint.
</p>

<p>
Richard Aldington’s contributions begin with <em>Childhood</em>, a study of a
lonely little boy in a horribly dull English town. It is full of wistfulness,
for the little boy is very real, and the detail is admirably managed. The
little boy is shut up in the ugly town, like a chrysalis in a matchbox:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I hate that town; ...</p>
      <p class="verse">There were always clouds, smoke, rain</p>
      <p class="verse">In that dingy little valley.</p>
      <p class="verse">It rained; it always rained.</p>
      <p class="verse">I think I never saw the sun until I was nine—</p>
      <p class="verse">And then it was too late;</p>
      <p class="verse">Everything’s too late after the first seven years.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
That is very vivid. So, too, is the description of the contents of the large
tin box in the attic. But Mr. Aldington never allows the descriptions to
usurp the poem; he keeps them properly subordinated to his theme, the
loneliness of the child.
</p>

<p>
Fine as this poem is, it seems more experimental than Mr. Aldington’s
shorter work. Long poems require a different technique from short poems,
and perhaps Mr. Aldington has not yet become quite master of it. It is
in the short poems that he is so eminently successful.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Poplar</em> is an almost perfect poem of its kind. A complete “image,”
and with that fine, poetic imagination which is the hall-mark of Mr. Aldington’s
best work. What could be more beautiful than this:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I know that the white wind loves you,</p>
      <p class="verse">Is always kissing you and turning up</p>
      <p class="verse">The white lining of your green petticoat.</p>
      <p class="verse">The sky darts through you like blue rain,</p>
      <p class="verse">And the grey rain drips on your flanks</p>
      <p class="verse">And loves you.</p>
      <p class="verse">And I have seen the moon</p>
      <p class="verse">Slip his silver penny into your pocket</p>
      <p class="verse">As you straightened your hair;</p>
      <p class="verse">And the white mist curling and hesitating</p>
      <p class="verse">Like a bashful lover about your knees.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
<em>The Poplar</em> is, on the whole, the best poem of Mr. Aldington’s in the
book, but <em>The Faun Sees Snow for the First Time</em> runs it close. And here
we have that divine gift of poetical humor which is another of Mr. Aldington’s
rare qualities. Space alone prevents me from quoting it. But if I
put these two first, where shall I put <em>Round-Pond</em>, with its sun “shining
upon the water like a scattering of gold crocus-petals”?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Aldington has advanced in his art. In spite of the <em>Faun</em> and
<em>Lemures</em>, he has sloughed off much of the Greek mannerism which marred
his work in the first anthology. The training which his Greek studies have
given him, is here put to excellent and individual use. One looks for much
from him in the future.
</p>

<p>
H. D.’s poems are undoubtedly the most perfect in the book. There
is nothing broad, nothing varied about her attempts, but what she tries
for she succeeds in doing, absolutely. But in her work, too, we find a grateful
change going on. The stage properties are no longer exclusively Greek.
In fact, only one poem of her seven has anything obviously Greek about it.
There is nothing specifically inartistic in this transplanting of the imagery
of another place and time into one’s work. But when an English poet fills
every poem full of Greek names and Greek devices, the result is intense
weariness on the part of the reader. The poems may be beautiful, but this
foreign flavour gives them a sort of chilling quality. One cannot help feeling
that the poet is straining after a poetical effect, and that stands in the way
of a complete sympathy between poet and reader.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
H. D. is too much of an artist not to have realized this, and in these
new poems (with the exception I have mentioned), there is no hint of direct
preoccupation with the Greek in title or text. Yet the poems are so completely
Greek that they might be translations from some newly-discovered
papyrus. And still, in reading them, one feels that the sincerity of the artist
is not to be questioned. Here is no striving after effect, but a complete saturation
of a personality in a past mode. If one believed in reincarnations,
one could say, and be certain, that H. D. was the reincarnation of some dead
Greek singer. The Greek habit sits upon her as easily as a dress, loosened by
constant wear. It is undubitably hers. To adopt another speech would be an
unpardonable artificiality. Realizing this, and not making the mistake that
so many reviewers have done in considering her a copyist, we must admit
that H. D.’s poems attain a perfection which is not to be found in the work
of any other modern poet. This garland of sea flowers is a masterpiece of
pure beauty. I have only space to quote one of these poems, but it shall be
quoted entire.

H. D. has her limitations, as I said before. They are the most obvious thing
about her, except her perfection. But it is so ridiculous to cavil at them,
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
as it would be to deny the loveliness of one of the sea flowers she writes
about, because it is not a forest of lofty trees.
</p>

<p>
To pass from H. D. to Mr. John Gould Fletcher is something in the
nature of a shock. It is a good deal like plunging into the ocean from a
warm, sunny cliff. One’s ears, and nose, and mouth, are filled with rushing
water. One feels in the grasp of an overwhelming power, and one struggles
to the surface, breathless, half-drowned, but wholly invigorated.
</p>

<p>
To drop the figure, these two poems of Mr. Fletcher’s are so full of
potentialities, so large in suggestion, that one hardly knows what to say
about them. Does <em>The Blue Symphony</em> mean life? I confess I do not
know. Is it merely a series of pictures? No, there is a vague undercurrent
to the poem which makes that impossible. It is the sort of poem which a
mystic might ponder over indefinitely and find new meanings every hour.
And yet it is all done with the precision and clearness of the Imagist theory.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to give any idea of the poem as a whole by quoting bits
of it. But little pieces, even divorced from their context, have that succinct
epigrammatic quality which is the stamp of genius. Here are three lines:

study of Japanese painting rather than from Japanese poetry.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fletcher’s versatility is shown by turning from <em>The Blue Symphony</em>,
to his other poem, <em>London Excursion</em>. Here the note of mysticism of <em>The
Blue Symphony</em> is entirely abandoned, and there is no hint of Japanese influence.
If <em>London Excursion</em> follows any lead, it is the lead of the new
schools of poetry and painting in France. But I will not insult Mr. Fletcher
by suggesting that he is, in any way, a disciple of Marinetti and the Futurists.
It is nearer the truth to say that he has realized the vividness of some
of their methods, and modified them to his own use.
</p>

<p>
<em>London Excursion</em> is one of the most interesting poems in this volume.
It is a poem of a man going into London in the morning by ’bus, spending
the day walking about the streets and going into shops, and coming home
at night by train. It sounds simple, but it is really the most amazing expression
of light, color, and unrelated impressions that one can conceive.
This is his impression of a street from his ’bus-top:

Mr. Flint’s work is always delightful. He has a winning way of taking
his reader into his confidence. This, and his love of nature, which he paints
with real affection, gains our sympathy at once. It must be admitted that
none of Mr. Flint’s seven poems quite equal two of his in the first anthology,
<em>London My Beautiful</em> and <em>The Swan</em>. One feels in these two poems a groping
quality, as though the poet were not quite satisfied with them himself.
As though the first <em>élan</em> with which he adopted the <em>vers libre</em> medium were
passing away, and he were beginning to realize that the form has its limitations.
</p>

<p>
If there is any truth in this, it is evident, however, that Mr. Flint has
not yet made up his mind to try anything else. It would be almost a pity if
he did, for few <em>vers librists</em> understand the manipulation of cadence as he
does. Perhaps the following is the one of these poems which has most of his
characteristic charm:

<em>Malady</em> strikes a stronger note than anything of Mr. Flint’s that I have
read before. It is excellent psychology, and steadily, astringently done.
</p>

<p>
It is this constant change and growth which makes the progress of this
little group so interesting to watch. Mr. Flint’s work in the first anthology
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
seemed quite successful and finished. He had done what he had done excellently,
and he would go on doing it to the end of the chapter. But here we
see Mr. Flint, dissatisfied with mere success, daring a wider horizon. From
the point of view of adequacy of technique, his poems suffer, as is natural;
but the technique is sure to follow the widened thought, before long. <em>Malady</em>
and the poem called <em>Fragment</em> show the direction in which Mr. Flint is moving.
His next work will be interesting to see.
</p>

<p>
Mr. D. H. Lawrence is the best known of the poets in this book, although
a newcomer to the anthology. No modern writer is more vigorous
than he, and none is more entirely, almost brutally sincere. In Mr. Lawrence’s
novels this brutality is sometimes excessively evident, but always one
feels that the author inflicts pain upon himself as well as his readers; that
he says what he sees and is concerned not to shirk and be a coward for his
own comfort.
</p>

<p>
In his poetry, Mr. Lawrence seems to be more lenient with himself. It
is as though he allowed the moralist in him a day out. Not that he ever
ceases to be a moralist, really. But he permits himself to lay a slight covering
over the stark nakedness of disagreeable facts. This covering is poetry,
and very beautiful and original poetry it is.

Mr. Lawrence has solved the problem of <em>vers libre</em> for himself, by writing
in a rhymed metre which usually defies all scansion, but which gives a queer,
and most satisfactory effect, of elasticity and strength. For this reason, and
for its novelty, Mr. Lawrence’s manner is very interesting, but his matter is
still more so. Read <em>The Mowers</em>, a common tragedy, but put so newly and
strikingly that it comes upon one with all its original force.
</p>

<p>
<em>Fireflies in the Corn</em> and <em>A Woman to Her Dead Husband</em> are new in
subject as well as in presentation, and they have a bald reality about them
which I have never met in any other poem. But never once does Mr. Lawrence
make the mistake of being only a realist; he never ceases to be a poet.
In <em>Fireflies in the Corn</em> there are these lines:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">

The <em>Ballad of Another Ophelia</em> is probably his best poem. In it we see
his peculiar style at its very best.

<p>
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
Mr. Lawrence is the singer of truth, the lover of humanity. His inclusion
into the Imagist group shows that the school is broad and real enough
not to desire to shut itself up in the cupboard of precocity, as in the beginning
there was some fear of its doing.
</p>

<p>
Where Mr. Lawrence gives us the broadest view of Imagism from an
English standpoint that this newer, more vital group has offered us, Miss
Lowell does the same service for the American side. The qualities that make
her work noteworthy are first, a virtuoso command of language that fits itself
to the most diverse themes, and second, a sort of fantastic, curious irony
that is essentially American. This irony is perhaps at its finest in <em>The Traveling
Bear</em> and <em>The Letter</em>, but these are too long to quote. I choose instead
<em>Bullion</em>, which may be taken for a very modern type of love poem, in which
love itself becomes a burden:

Miss Lowell always looks at things from an angle. Her mind reflects
the unusual aspect and that most vividly. As she says of herself:

Miss Lowell has the ability which is rare among present-day poets of recognizing
that beauty does not belong to an epoch or a period, but is always the
same, under whatever strange form it may present itself.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless her most remarkable poem is that called <em>The Bombardment</em>.
Whether the technique adopted here by Miss Lowell is destined to work a
revolution in verse-writing remains for the future to settle. But here, at
least, it perfectly justifies itself. No one should permit, however, a question
of technique to obscure the deep tragedy, the splendid humanity, of this poem.
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
War has only one beauty: that of its terrible destructiveness of all beauty.
<em>The Bombardment</em> is the best statement of this aspect of war I know. It
must be read in its entirety, and so I will not attempt piecemeal quotation
of this most fitting conclusion to the volume.
</p>

<p>
This book is so provocative of thought, the poets in it are so suggestive,
each one by him—or herself, that each really requires a separate review.
But I have said enough to show what an important volume this little book
is. We are told that it is to be an annual, and certainly we shall watch its
succeeding appearances with great interest.

editors of Chicago magazines explained the virtues of their
respective journals, Lucien Cary said, politely but in effect, that
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> was no good. “The only striking thing it has
done (beside coming out at all) is to discover Emma Goldman, a
nice woman with views less radical than Emerson’s and certainly
far less well expressed.” I quote this because it is so exhilarating
to catch Mr. Cary in a half-truth—the kind of thing that makes for
the confused thinking he is so valiantly in arms against. If <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> had been alive about twenty-five years ago I hope
we would have had the sense to discover that a great woman was
beginning to work in this country. As it is, we could only try to
point out how difficult and how fine has been Emma Goldman’s
living of the things Emerson thought it would be good to live.
It was not for the people who know their Emerson that we tried it,
but for those who have forgotten him, like Mr. Cary....
Since we failed so miserably we shall have to try again. But in
the meantime you may hear Emma Goldman herself and discover
just how she is helping to make Emerson’s essays livable. She is
to lecture for a week in Chicago, in the most delightful lecture
room in the city—the Assembly Room in the Fine Arts Building.

“<em>Dionysion</em>”
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne</span> of the most stirring things that has come to this office lately
is a small journal with the word “Dionysion” on its cover.
It is the first volume of a magazine for the furtherance of Isadora
Duncan’s work in America, and the committee that has helped
make this rather amazing thing possible includes such names as
John W. Alexander, Percy MacKaye, Theodore Dreiser, Will Levington
Comfort, Max Eastman, Robert Henri, Edith Wynne Mathison,
Julia Culp, Witter Bynner, John Drew, Walter Damrosch, and
many others. On the first page is Whitman, then Nietzsche on
Dionysian Art, and then Robert Henri with a little article on the
new education in which he says: “I was tremendously impressed
one day in Isadora Duncan’s studio, by the look in the faces of the
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
children. As they passed by me in the dance I saw great dignity,
balance, ease. I was impressed, too, throughout the entire time by
the fact that they seemed absolutely secure in their happiness. They
appeared to know unconsciously that they would receive a full
measure of praise and that in no case would there be blame or punishment.
In each little upturned face was a rare look of freedom—the
look of people on a higher plane of self-consciousness, an aloofness
from the common thought. I saw in their expression the
impress of the measures of great music.” And he goes on that “to
inspire courage in children, to stimulate them with the work of
those who have the courage to create, to make of them frank facers
of the emotional problems of life, to start them on the way toward
a great constructive life, we must take care not to impose our wisdom
and our ignorance on them, but to give them the benefit of the
best we have through a frank response to their natural interrogation.”
Isadora Duncan’s idea is that “the expression of the modern
school of ballet wherein each action is an end, and no movement,
pose, or rhythm is successive or can be made to evolve succeeding
action, is an expression of degeneration, of living death. All the
movements of our modern ballet school are sterile movements because
they are unnatural; their purpose is to create the delusion that
the law of gravitation does not exist for them.” I know a man
from Russia who came to this country knowing only two words of
English: “Isadora Duncan.” He had seen Miss Duncan dance
once in St. Petersburg and from that moment he looked forward to
America as the country of “highest intelligences in the freest bodies.”
We may sometime become worthy of this remarkable woman.

families driven from the war zone, there died in Warsaw a
great poet, Isaac Loeb Peretz, almost unknown to the English
reader, if we do not count one volume of his <em>Tales</em>, issued by the
Jewish Publication Society. His poetry, written in Hebrew and in
Yiddish, may be compared to that of Heine in its gracefulness, but
it bears in addition the melancholy of Polish skies. His sketches in
prose and his dramas are too subtle in their profound symbolism to
be appreciated by the Jewish masses, who nevertheless, worship
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
him as one of the few great artists who had not gone over to till
strange fields, richer and more remunerative. The Jewish stage in
America flourishes on Gordin’s melodramas and on cheap farces;
the theatrical managers are too business-like to produce such a high

cruel machine! I was in court all day until ten that night. I was
near a collapse, so terribly had the day impressed me. At midnight
they telephoned to tell me of the verdict. The horror of it all to me
is the material which Polgnani chose—two typical proletarian slaves,
one a boot black, the other a cobbler, both underdeveloped from
malnutrition, irresponsible in their youthful inexperience, like two
frightened deer driven at bay. To hear the lawyers refer to them
as ‘fools,’ ‘degenerates,’ ‘ignoramuses,’ without a sign of protest on
their part, almost drove me crazy. I had to restrain myself from

prejudice and a lack of illusion concerning American criminals or I would
commit my atrocity on American soil. They, American criminals, are as
a rule a petty lot given to sentimental regrets and griefs and reforms and
periodicals. There is nothing which reflects the smugness of a people so
much as the manner and temperament of its vice. And the temperament of
American vice is more distinctly and monotonously bourgeois than any of its
virtues. The American citizen even when about to be hanged is unable to
rise above the commonplace reactions “imagined” for his predicament by
such authors as belong to the Indiana Society.

the sake of the warm blood that bathed their hands. The filthy saints and
nonchalant parricides. The Herculean villains, the irritable gargoyles innocently
steeped in insatiable perversion and dripping with infamy. The
arrogant, sadistic artists of torture, human as children, with their pitifully
crippled souls; praying before the prison ikons, stealing their comrade’s
clothes and washing his feet; hating and loving with the simplicity of Pagan
gods and the ramified cunning of continental diplomats. The nerveless

They stand alone in literature. Only Christ could have written of
them as well as Dostoevsky. Was Dostoevsky dreaming of a new religion
when he filled the pages with his human crucifixions? Probably not. But
his artistry and his painstaking, searching minute psychology have illumined
<em>The House of the Dead</em> so that for him who is not afraid it is as holy and
human a source of inspiration as the loving sacrifices of the Nazarene
Thaumaturgist.
</p>

<p>
And yet it is a simple book. There are very few writings so direct
and simple, so easy to read and to understand. The terrifying lusts and
passions and distorted rages make the mind quiver, but they never mystify.
The harrowing morbidities pierce the intelligence like hot lances, but they
never blunt or deprave the moral senses. The fierce pathos so exquisitely
written, the blood-soaked restraints, the consumptive dying in his iron fetters
too weak to support the weight of the little cross on his chest, the wild, inhuman
humanness—they sizzle away the nerve cuticles and burn the emotions
with a strange fire.
</p>

<p>
It is the peculiar paradox of reaction. I visited once a Home for
Crippled Children and came away happier and cleaner. There the little
misshapen bodies and the unconscious holiness of their suffering suddenly
revealed to me things I had scoffingly overlooked in the popular words of
accepted divines. And it is the same way with the company that writhes
through the pages of Dostoevsky’s book. A more material illustration of
this paradox is the very rhapsodics I have indulged in to convey what I
have read. There are no rhapsodies in the book. There is no “dramatic
action” at all in the book. It is the most inactive book I ever have read,
barring not certain memoirs and diaries. Nothing happens in the book,
yet from its start a demoralized pageant marches thunderingly across the
pages, and somehow, by a psychological process it would take Dostoevsky
again to reveal, lifts the spirit to heights as lofty as its itinerary is low. As
for the style of its writing, there are no secrets in the art for the great
Russian. And here he chooses the grim, gripping reiteration, the tragic calm
and human poesy of simple words to build up his staggering effects.
</p>

<p>
What will Americans think of the book providing it becomes popular?—and
it may. (The idolatrous regard born in this country for Russian art
instances the possibilities of American hysteria directed in the proper channels.)
The great majority of them, however—particularly those with whom
I have mentioned my horror of spending ten years—will feel it incumbent
upon them to be outraged, none more so than the criminal fraternity. It is
perhaps stretching a point to say that even so were the highly and lowly
estimable backbones of an earlier period of less comparative moribund piety
outraged by the Sermon on the Mount. But there is a promising likelihood
that their ectypes will never read the volume and will thus be saved or lost
or whatever you will. And those who see the light from this Sermon in
the Depths can effect an exclusiveness which will merit them the flattering
curses and derisions of their fellow men for many sweet years to come.

The translation is by Constance Garnett and is excellently done. Mrs.
Garnett, more than any linguist, has in her work conveyed the atmosphere
and idiom and temperament of the Russian into English. She is responsible
for the remarkable translations of Turgeniev which have carried his art
unchanged into another tongue, as well as for the Dostoevsky novels. For
the benefit of readers who will be puzzled by her footnote on page 11, the
“Green Street” which she is unable to define is the avenue formed between
two ranks of prison soldiers through which the condemned convict is wheeled
and beaten. The soldiers stand armed with fresh, green sticks which flash
brightly in the sun as they swish down on the naked back—hence the jocular
name.

Notes For a Review of “The Spoon
River Anthology”
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Carl Sandburg</span>
</p>

<p class="book">
<em>The Spoon River Anthology, by Edgar Lee Masters.
(The Macmillan Company, New York)</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> saw Masters write this book. He wrote it in snatched moments between
fighting injunctions against a waitresses’ union striving for the right
to picket and gain one day’s rest a week, battling from court to court for
compensation to a railroad engineer rendered a loathsome cripple by the
defective machinery of a locomotive, having his life amid affairs as intense
as those he writes of.
</p>

<p>
At The Book and Play Club one night Masters tried to tell how he
came to write the Anthology. Of course, he couldn’t tell. There are no
writers of great books able to tell the how and why of a dominating spirit
that seizes them and wrenches the flashing pages from them. But there
are a few forces known that play a part. And among these Masters said he
wanted emphasis placed on <em>Poetry</em>, voices calling “Unhand me,” verses and
lines from all manner and schools of writers welcomed in Harriet Monroe’s
magazine.
</p>

<p>
Once in a while a man comes along who writes a book that has his
own heart-beats in it. The people whose faces look out from the pages of
the book are the people of life itself, each trait of them as plain or as mysterious
as in the old home valley where the writer came from. Such a writer
and book are realized here.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
Masters’ home town is Lewiston, Illinois, on the banks of the Spoon
River. There actually is such a river where Masters waded bare-foot as a
boy, and where the dead and the living folk of his book have fished or swam,
or thrown pebbles and watched the widening circles. It is not far, less than
a few hours’ drive, from where Abraham Lincoln was raised. People who
knew Lincoln are living there today.
</p>

<p>
Well, some two hundred and twenty portraits in free verse have been
etched by Masters from this valley. They are Illinois people. Also they
are the people of anywhere and everywhere in so-called civilization.
</p>

<p>
Aner Clute is the immortal girl of the streets. Chase Henry is the
town drunkard of all time. The railroad lawyer, the corrupt judge, the
prohibitionist, the various adulterers and adulteresses, the Sunday School
superintendent, the mothers and fathers who lived for sacrifice in gratitude,
joy,—all these people look out from this book with haunting eyes, and there
are baffled mouths and brows calm in the facing of their destinies.
</p>

<p>
When a few of the pieces in this book reached Ezra Pound, the judgment
he passed upon them was that they are real and great poetry from
the hand of a new and a genuine American poet. It was Alice Corbin Henderson
who was the first American critic to seize upon some of these poems
as they were running in <em>The St. Louis Mirror</em>, and put them forward in
<em>Poetry</em> as striking, indigenous, out of the soil of America as a home-land.
William Marion Reedy, editor of <em>The St. Louis Mirror</em>, is accredited by
Masters for the keen enthusiasm with which he helped him carry along
the work of writing.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1914 Masters not only handled all of his regular law practice,
heavy and grilling. Besides, he wrote <em>The Spoon River Anthology</em>.
There were times when he was clean fagged with the day’s work. But a
spell was on him to throw into written form a picture gallery, a series of
short movies of individuals he had seen back home. Each page in the
anthology is a locked-up portrait now freed.
</p>

<p>
The stress of this bore down on Masters. Just before the proof sheets
for his book came to his hands, he went down with fever and pneumonia
and a complex of physical ills. It was the first time in his life he was willing
to admit he was “sick abed.”
</p>

<p>
There is vitality, drops of heart blood, poured into Lee Masters’ book.
He has other books in him as vivid and poignant. Let us hope luck holds
him by the hand and takes him along where he can write out these
other ones.

Poetry and the Panama-Pacific

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">as</span> poetry, as an art, any meaning whatever for the American people, or
has all the recent ink which has been spilled in proclaiming a renascence
of American poetry gone only to water the roots of the publishing business?
These are questions which will be forced upon the mind of every admirer of
the lyric muse in contemplating the Panama-Pacific International Exposition
in San Francisco. For in spite of the millions of money and the acres
of ground at the disposal of the American sections there is nowhere, except
in the commercial exhibits of the publishers, any recognition of the existence
of contemporary poetry.
</p>

<p>
When taxed with the fact that the art is unrepresented the heads of the
departments point deprecatingly to the fact that as a decorative feature of
certain architectural archways poetical quotations are used. There is a quotation
from Confucius, one from the Kalidasa, several from Edmund Spencer,
and one (O Triumph of Modernity!) from Walt Whitman. As no commercial
exhibit is accepted which was in existence at the time of the St. Louis
Exposition this answer is doubly enlightening.
</p>

<p>
All the other arts are here. Architecture, music, sculpture, mural and
easel painting, drawing, prints and etching, landscape gardening, together
with the so-called “Liberal Arts” are adequately represented. But not poetry.
A perusal of the “P’s” of the official list in an attempt to discover it is significant.
“Poultry” is there with a large exhibit, so is “Plumbago,” “Plumbers’
Implements,” “Pomology” and “Ponies.” Excellent exhibits all, but hardly
lyrical.
</p>

<p>
It may be urged, of course, that other arts, such as the arts of the theatre,
acting and stagecraft, and the literary art of prose writing, are also omitted.
But although exhibitions of these things would be eminently desirable they
present great practical difficulties. And these arts have, after all, a commercial
side which is more or less adequately suggested. But with poetry
the case is different. The mere fact that commercially poetry is, like Perlmutter’s
automobile, a liability and not an asset, ought in our practical age
to prove that it is a “fine art!” And the practical difficulty of providing a
set of bookshelves and a competent jury to pass on admissions need hardly
stagger the directors of so colossal an undertaking. Add to this daily, or
even bi-weekly, readings of contemporary poetry and the result would be a
representation in proportion to the attention paid the other arts.
</p>

<p>
It would be useless to urge that this Exposition is a private, or even a
local enterprise. It cannot stand as such. It represents in the face of the
warring world the development of our country, culturally as well as commercially.
And the fact that one of the oldest and most reverenced of the arts
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
is totally unrepresented must inevitably redound to the discredit of the executive
officers, and through them of the people at large.
</p>

<p>
For the root of this cavalier treatment of poetry is, after all, in the
American people. As a nation, in spite of our complacency in the present
world crisis, we are still in the stage of culture in which we believe that man
can live by bread alone. And we can scarcely hope for more adequate recognition
of the art until those of us to whom poetry is a living fact, and not an
academic perception, have battled at greater length and with greater self-sacrifice
in the eternal struggle through commercialism to beauty.

The Mob-God
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> seats creak expectantly. The white whirr of the movie machine takes
on a special significance. In the murky gloom of the theater you can
watch row on row of backs becoming suddenly enthusiastic, necks growing
suddenly alive, heads rising to a fresh angle. Turning around you can
see the stupid masks falling, vacant eyes lighting up, lips parting and waiting
the smile, mouths opening waiting to laugh. A miracle is transpiring. A
sodden mass inclined toward protoplasmic atavism, a smear of dead nerves,
dead skin, fiberless flesh is beginning to quiver with an emotion. Laughter
is about to be born. The lights dance on the screen in front. Letters appear
in two short words and a gasp sweeps from mouth to mouth.
</p>

<p>
The name of a Mob-God flashes before the eyes. Suddenly the screen
in front vanishes. In its place appears a road stretching away to the sky
and lined with trees. The sky is clear. The scene is cool and healthy. The
leaves of the trees flutter familiarly. The road smiles like an old friend.
And far in the distance a speck appears and moves slowly and jerkily. Wide
open mouths and freshened eyes watch the speck grow larger. It takes the
form of a man, a little man with a thin cane. At last his baggy trousers
and his slovenly shoes are visible. His thick curly hair under the battered
derby becomes clear. He walks along carelessly, quietly, with an infinite
philosophy. He walks with an indescribable step, kicking up one of his
feet, shuffling along.
</p>

<p>
Laughter is born. The vapid faces respond magically to His presence.
Pure, childish delight sounds. The faces are bathed in a human light. A
noisy, wholesome din fills the theater. And the little man comes down the
road with his calm and solemn face, his sad eyes, his impossible mustache,
his ridiculous trousers, and his nervous, spasmodic gait amid the roars and
wild elation of idiots, prostitutes, crass, common churls, and empty souls
converted suddenly into a natural and mutual simplicity. The stuffy, maddening
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
“bathoes” that clings to the mob like a stink is dispelled, wiped out
of the air. Laughter, laughter, shrieks and peals, chuckles and smiles, the
broad permeating warmth of the simplest, deepest joy is everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Charlie Chaplin is before them, Charles Chaplin with the wit of a vulgar
buffoon and the soul of a world artist. He walks, he stumbles, he dances,
he falls. His inimitable gyrations release torrents of mirth clean as spring
freshets. He is cruel. He is absurd; unmanly; tawdry; cheap; artificial.
And yet behind his crudities, his obscenities, his inartistic and outrageous
contortions, his “divinity” shines. He is the Mob-God. He is a child and a
clown. He is a gutter snipe and an artist. He is the incarnation of the
latent, imperfect, and childlike genius that lies buried under the fiberless
flesh of his worshippers. They have created Him in their image. He is
the Mob on two legs. They love him and laugh.

<p class="subt">
(<em>The Chicago Little Theatre</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> don’t want to write about <em>Rosmersholm</em> or about Ibsen now. I want
to write about Mme. Borgny Hammer, who is great in the manner of
the great Norwegians.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of talk about the Russian soul just at present. I wish
the Norwegian soul might come in for its share of analysis and appreciation.
It is interesting not because of its dark shudderings but because of its intense
light and its clearness. It is like the sun; it is like wild flowers—not the
delicate but the hardy ones.
</p>

<p>
Mme. Hammer is this sort of person. She is an actress because she
must act or die. She is so intense that the air about her is always “charged”;
and she is so natural and simple that you know right away she must be great.
There wasn’t a particle of difference between her presence on the stage as
the Ibsen heroine and her manner when she meets you on Michigan Avenue
and stops to say that Ibsen is so wonderful it’s impossible to cut a line of
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
his dialogue. In both situations she is the genius. Mrs. Fiske’s Rebecca
West was a stunningly-worked-out idea; Mme. Hammer’s was just—Rebecca
West. Mrs. Fiske had a theory of the character and presented it in a series
of subtle and powerful designs. But what did this wonderful woman do?
She didn’t act Rebecca West at all: she just gave you the impression that
she is Rebecca every day of her life. She made <em>Rosmersholm</em> a natural
scene in the life of some modern family, instead of making it a “study”—an
effect in a rather strained psychology.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could describe Mme. Hammer’s stage conversations—especially
the parts where she listens. She is so busy feeling Rebecca West that she
has no time to waste in managing her eyes and voice and hands. They
take care of themselves just as they would in her own library. When our
best actresses “listen” they keep their eyes on the person who is talking with
the kind of look that says: “I know it would be bad art now to look at the
audience out of the tail of my eye. I must pay close attention to what this
actor is saying to me.” Mme. Hammer looks at Rosmer with the same
expression she would wear if he were about to say things she hadn’t heard
him rehearse every day for six weeks. If she should break out with some
dialogue of her own it couldn’t sound any more spontaneous than her reading
of the lines Ibsen gave to Rebecca. I know Rebecca’s lines, and yet I
forgot them and decided she must be making things up as she went along.
What richness of simplicity, and what a sturdy beauty!
</p>

<p>
I have never seen an actress who cares less about herself than Mme.
Hammer and cares so deeply for the character she is presenting. The
expressions of her face are marvelous.... She said to me once that
she disagreed with critics who thought Hedda <a id="corr-24"></a>Gabler had nothing to give.
“She had so much, so very much to give,” she said passionately. No wonder
she thinks so: she is a big woman who herself has an infinity of things
to give.

<p class="noindent">
Of the production of <em>The Trojan Women</em> of Euripides by The Little
Theatre Company, at the Blackstone Theatre, Sunday, April 11th, one might
waste many, many words and much good space. One might make merry
over the quaint little mannikins trying their hardest to look like Spartan
soldiers. Or again, a whole column might be devoted to the insipid posturings
of the saintly-pretty lady who played Helen. Much sarcasm might be
expended on the flops done, in the approved French-tragedy style, by the
lady who played Andromache. A whole thesis might be written by an enterprising
student at some correspondence school on the use of the Vaudeville
Spotlight in Classic Greek Tragedy. And Hamlet’s advice to the players
might be quoted with some profit to a few of the company: pointed emphasis
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
at the “do not <em>mouth</em> your words” part of the advice, to the lady who speaks
the speech beginning:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Lo, yonder ships: I ne’er set foot on one,</p>
      <p class="verse">But tales and pictures tell, when over them</p>
      <p class="verse">Breaketh a storm not all too strong to stem,</p>
      <p class="verse">Each man strives hard, the tiller gripped, the mast</p>
      <p class="verse">Manned, the hull baled, to face it, till at last</p>
      <p class="verse">Too strong breaks the o’erwhelming sea: lo, then</p>

      <p class="verse">To fate and the wild waters.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And last of all one might say unkind things about the blending of the
voices in the chorus.
</p>

<p>
All the above points, however, I know are very debatable. There are
two that cannot be debated. Two that outbalance by far all the other defects
of the production.
</p>

<p>
If all the cast had voices like corncrakes, and used them after the manner
of country-town amateurs, the production would still be worth seeing for
the thrilling pictures of colour and line presented by individuals and the
ensemble. And rising, soaring away above all the petty little defects is the
wonderful, majestical verse of Euripides. What could be more beautiful
than the lyric:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Even as the sound of a song</p>
      <p class="verse">Left by the way, but long</p>
      <p class="verse">Remembered, a tune of tears</p>
      <p class="verse">Falling where no man hears,</p>
      <p class="verse">In the old house as rain,</p>
        <p class="verse1">For things loved of yore:</p>
      <p class="verse">But the dead hath lost his pain</p>
        <p class="verse1">And weeps no more.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
It is greatly to be regretted that it has been thought fit to cut that lyric,
Cassandra’s Hymn to Hymen, and many of the other beautiful parts of the
play.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing might have been better in a hundred ways—then again
it might have been worse in ten hundred ways. Let us be glad that we had
an opportunity of seeing the wonderful thing, even though the Carnegie
Peace Foundation is backing it up.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">B</span><span class="postfirstchar">usoni—prophet.</span> Where Bauer is a priest, Hofmann a wonder-child,
Bachaus a poet, Ganz an efficient, Paderewski a magician, and Samaroff a
failure—Busoni is a prophet. His voice arrests the senses, throws a silence
over them. At first, the world is obscured; later the last trace of it is gone.
The song of the prophet vibrates through new spaces. Listening ones
follow without restraint, so great is the magnetic pull of it; they follow,
enchanted, through new spaces to new and miraculous realms of life, where
music is more real than ivory or pine.
</p>

<p>
With one paragraph’s deference to the clay-members, let them be informed
that Ferruccio Busoni is a composer and concert-pianist, almost
fifty years old, who began his study and piano-practice at a most tender age,
and who is now considered to be something of an artist—that is, when he
isn’t off pursuing some new notion about quarter-tones, or his one hundred
and thirteen new scales for the pianoforte. He has these aberrations. But
then, musicians are crazy anyway. At a recent concert with the Chicago
Symphony Mr. Busoni played one concerto by Saint-Saëns and another one
which he himself composed. Incidentally, Mr. Busoni’s composition was
based on North America. It is the least bit regrettable that we are so busy
and hurried that Mr. Busoni could introduce us, through a work of art,
to the country we hurry over. He played these works on an inferior piano
and did several questionable things in his playing, such as let his wrist sag,
etc. His personal friends insist that he hates to play the piano. Let the
clay-members join the blessed minority in silent thanksgiving that he has
hated it hard enough to have scornfully brushed aside the limitations of wood
and wire, that his hatred is greater than a world of near-love.
</p>

<p>
On his recent appearance here, at the very start, Busoni passed above
the norm of virtuosity in piano-manipulation, and the tonal explorations
began. It was quite bewildering. The mob thought it was fine. The
authorities had to admit that it was good. Young ladies considered it
divine. Professional musicians—always self-appointed and astute critics—were
prevented from indulging in their customary snap-judgments while
the artist played, and were held, opinionless, to the music. The listeners
who possessed not only sensitive ears but also receptive minds and fluent
imaginations were swung clear of earth, were lifted into a region where
no dead wall separated them from the strong voice of the prophet. He
was saying tremendous things. He forced upon smaller minds the rush,
the splendor, the glittering plunge of tones, such as they had never dreamed
of before. He gave them the dream. And this was what the yet smaller
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
and the very smallest minds, down between the dead walls, admired, but
sanctioned grudgingly, as brilliant style. There were noisy hands and
exclamations, as at a cock-fight. But the blessed minority heard and recognized
the piano-playing of today, tomorrow, and the future. The instrument
had at last shaken off the curse of apartment houses, and had come
into its own.
</p>

<p>
Wilhelm Bachaus sings the fancies of a dreamy young poet; Paderewski
thrills his audience whether he smiles or sulks at the keyboard; Bauer
intones the affirmation of a lovely faith in tonal beauty; Godowsky presents
necklaces of perfectly carven gems to the subtly responsive ones; these men
and a few others justify their own uses of the pianoforte. They are strongly
individual, and are not to be balanced, one against another. Ferruccio
Busoni, however, would cast a shadow if he traveled earthward from his
altitudes. He is solitary and unique. Others work up through human
difficulties in order to perfect their means of expressing tonal ideals. Busoni
takes their goal as a fresh starting-point, and tonal ideals become a further
means, to voice the surge of strength which he essentially is, to express the
resistless, flashing drive of the universe. His flying clusters of notes are
the tail of a comet, of some swift participator in cosmic rhythms. The
swirl of his music-fire is a glorious something for which the pianoforte must
providentially have been created—a genuine offering to the vigilant keepers
of Beauty.

Miss Robinson is an Illinois girl who came to Chicago to be Fannie
Bloomfield Zeisler’s “artist pupil” (or something like that) and chief assistant.
A year ago she was playing the piano efficiently; this year she is
using that as a starting-point and proving that she has a real right to the
instrument. She has a technical foundation that cannot fail her; it is
already equal to practically all the tests she may need to put it to, and she
uses it as surely and unconsciously as one uses his feet to walk with. Her
playing at present has the clearness and innocence of a brook; if she can
get something of the sea into her feeling she will be big. The music Carol
Robinson gives is not so far the expression of some incredible longing to
make the piano serve as an outlet. It is natural and beautiful—and absolutely
untroubled. It is articulate and yet it has not acquired a meaning.
It is without a hint of intensity. Carol Robinson has the most interesting
part of the struggle before her—the part for which her genius for hard work
is merely a preparation: what does she want to say through the piano?

James Whittaker’s music is very personal, very sensitive, very charming,
and very marked by good taste. It is by far the most musical playing
I have heard in Chicago. Mr. Whittaker went to Berlin to study and then
to Paris, where he finished and became an ardent exponent of the French
school. His technical equipment is not the perfect tool that Carol Robinson’s
is; by which I don’t mean that it is at all inadequate, but somehow
you feel that he is always conscious of the demands he puts upon it and that
it sometimes leaves him unsatisfied. His theory is that most of the methods
taught outside the French Conservatoire are “short cuts”; but his work
suggests that he succeeds in spite of his theory. For he does succeed in
the one great essential: in making music. His relation to the piano is a
dedication, and his music is vibrant with feeling. His tone production is
a pressure with a fine nervousness in it, and he has the real “pearl” quality
in his scales. His Chopin is perhaps, as he himself says, a little “scientific.”
His César Franck just misses being deep <em>enough</em>. He is at his best in quite
modern French music, or in a thing like Grieg’s Cradle Song which he plays
very, very beautifully. Brahms he doesn’t want to play, I imagine; but the
breadth that Brahms requires and gives is the very quality that would make
what James Whittaker has to say (and is saying very charmingly) a bigger
and deeper thing.

<p class="book">
<em>Four weeks in the Trenches, by Fritz Kreisler.</em> [<em>Houghton
Mifflin Company, Boston.</em>]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I had a big day with Ruby Davis, our Chicago little violinist, out in
the country, roaming, climbing, racing, conversing, but not talking. Talk
we left behind us, in the city drawing-rooms. Between pranks and escapades
we found rest in sitting side by side and reading Kreisler’s war impressions.
I knew that Ruby worshipped Fritz, but his reflections on the
book of the violinist have shown me that in addition to admiration he
possesses critical perception. We delighted in the pages written with spontaneous
beauty, without pose, without the banal superstructure of sentimental
colors, but revealing a tense, vibrating, virile artistic heart, reservedly
sensitive to bloody horrors as well as to imperceptible impressions of human
emotions concealed beneath the dehumanizing military uniform. Ruby
called my attention to the fact that only such an artist as Kreisler could
have had a broad non-professional outlook on men and things, an artist of
unusual versatility, of a wide education, of rich experiences in various fields
of life. Yet, he added, only the keen, delicate ear of a musician could have
perceived the symphonic sounds on the battle-field and in the trenches, as,
for instance, in this passage:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
My ear, accustomed to differentiate sounds of all kinds, had some time ago, while
we were still advancing, noted a remarkable discrepancy in the peculiar whine produced
by the different shells in their rapid flight through the air as they passed over
our heads, some sounding shrill, with a rising tendency, and the other rather dull,
with a falling cadence. A short observation revealed the fact that the passing of
a dull sounding shell was invariably preceded by a flash from one of our own cannon
in the rear on the hill, which conclusively proved it to be an Austrian shell. It must
be understood that as we were advancing between the positions of the Austrian and
Russian artillery, both kinds of shells were passing over our heads. As we advanced
the difference between shrill and dull shell grew less and less perceptible, until I could
hardly tell them apart. Upon nearing the hill the difference increased again more
and more until on the hill itself it was very marked. After our trench was finished
I crawled to the top of the hill until I could make out the flash of the Russian guns
on the opposite heights and by timing flash and actual passing of the shell, found to
my astonishment that now the Russian missiles had become dull, while on the other
hand, the shrill sound was invariably heralded by a flash from one of our guns, now
far in the rear. What had happened was this: Every shell describes in its course a
parabolic line, with the first half of the curve being ascending and the second one
descending. Apparently in the first half of its curve, that is, its course while ascending,
the shell produced a dull whine accompanied by a falling cadence, which changes
to a rising shrill as soon as the acme has been reached and the curve points downward
again. The acme for both kinds of shells naturally was exactly the half distance
between the Austrian and Russian artillery and this was the point where I had
noticed that the difference was the least marked. A few days later, in talking over
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
my observation with an artillery officer, I was told the fact was known that the shells
sounded different going up than when going down, but this knowledge was not used
for practical purposes. When I told him that I could actually determine by the sound
the exact place where a shell coming from the opposing batteries was reaching its
acme, he thought that this would be of great value in a case where the position of the
opposing batteries was hidden and thus could be located. He apparently spoke to
his commander about me, for a few days later I was sent on a reconnoitering tour,
with the object of marking on the map the exact spot where I thought the hostile
shells were reaching their acme, and it was later on reported to me that I had succeeded
in giving to our batteries the almost exact range of the Russian guns. I have
gone into the matter at some length, because it is the only instance where my musical
ear was of value during my service.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Ruby kept on explaining Kreisler while we were making our way
through picturesque ravines. Then we stormed a steep bluff that made a
difficult climb, and I had to pull and push my gentle co-adventurer. “Be
brave, little Kreisler!” He turned to me with serious eyes, and proceeded
to point out the greatness of his god, who throughout the book does not
even once show any national narrowness or hatred for the enemy, who
speaks with equal sympathy of the Russians and of the Austrians, who relates
his terrible experiences in the swampy trenches in such a calm, modest
tone, making your heart bleed with sorrow for the hardships and suffering
of the belligerents. What a terrible calamity it would have been had the
Cossack slashed Kreisler’s hand instead of his leg! Ruby smiled with joy
reading the last page in which the violinist regrets that he had been pronounced
“invalid and physically unfit for armed duty” and had “to discard
his well-beloved uniform for the nondescript garb of the civilian.” Ruby
does not share his big brother’s regret.

<p class="book">
<em>Criticisms of Life, by Horace Bridges.</em> [<em>Houghton
Mifflin Company, Boston.</em>]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ome</span> time ago, at a meeting of the Book and Play Club, Mr. Bridges
complained against <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> wherein a certain book was criticised
and labeled “naive and dull as the sermon of an Ethical Society preacher.”
“Ladies and gentlemen, <em>I am naive and dull</em>!” protested Mr. Bridges. The
reviewer of that unfortunate book, who happened to be present, expressed
his surprise at the complainer’s unmodest assumption that those epithets
were meant for him, as if he had monopolized the characteristic features of all
ethical preachers. Now that Mr. Bridges’ book is out, the reviewer wishes
to make amends and apologize; verily, the distinguished preacher was justified
in claiming the honorary titles.
</p>

<p>
The author analyzes his problems through the prism of empirico-pragmatic
rationalism, if such a combination is thinkable. Whether it be Chesterton’s
theological views, or Ellen Key’s marriage theory, or Maeterlinck’s
mysticism, or Sir Lodge’s ideas on immortality—the author applies to them
the same apparatus for testing their validity and truth: Are they provable?
Are they workable? Are they in harmony with Mr. Bridges’s ethical standard?
A few citations will illustrate the critic’s method and sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
He takes Gilbert Chesterton very seriously, and indignantly reproves
him for such typically Chestertonian offences as misquoting his opponents,
as paradoxical buffooneries, “unpardonable tricks” and “inexcusable mistakes”;
he offers him a few lessons in theology, explains to him in an earnest
tone the meaning of miracles, the Fall of Man, and finally comes to the
astounding discovery that the readers “will see in Mr. Chesterton’s amateur
apologetics nothing but a psychological curiosity, to be read, like his novels,
for amusement, in some slight degree perhaps for edification, but not at all
for instruction.” <a id="corr-26"></a>Horribile dictu!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bridges’s heaviest cannon are directed against Ellen Key. He
totally destroys her and Shaw’s opposition to marriage with one humorous
stroke, arguing that if that institution were really bad it would either have
destroyed humanity, or the revolted conscience of mankind would have
“risen and annihilated the abominable thing.” This optimistic argument
needs as little comment as the author’s logical conclusion that “free love”
is equivalent to prostitution and that free divorce is synonymous with adultery,
or as these pearls:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I am decidedly of opinion that in a more enlightened age divorce will be as
completely obsolete as duelling is to-day in England.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
I am opposed to divorce on this ground (incompatibility of temper) for two
reasons: first, because if people’s tempers are really so incompatible as to make their
lifelong companionship intolerable, they can, and therefore ought to, know this in
time to prevent their union. And, secondly, because such incompatibility as can remain
entirely concealed before marriage cannot possibly be so great but that it may be
overcome and harmonized after marriage by means of proper self-discipline and true
grasp of the idea of duty.
</p>

<p>
No soldier would be pardoned for deserting from the army on the ground that
he found his temper hopelessly incompatible with that of his comrades and his officers.
No party to a business contract would be absolved from observing its terms upon
any such consideration.
</p>

<p>
The right to renounce marriage because of unhappiness would logically involve
the right to commit suicide for the same reason.... Who are we that we should
repudiate the universe because it will not devote itself to securing our petty pleasures
and happinesses?... Marriage, like every other great social ordinance, is instituted
not primarily to secure our happiness, but to enable us to discharge our duty, in the
matter of the perpetuation and spiritual development of the human species.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
I am confident that the reader will appreciate the reviewer’s gallantry
in not taking issue with the quoted statements: it would be too easy a task
to exercise one’s humor over such threadbare niceties. My only apology
for devoting so much space to Mr. Bridges’s book is the fact that Mr. Bridges
is one of the moulders of public opinion in Chicago, hence ... I shall
owe one more apology for my unrestrainable desire to quote the closing lines
of the author’s sermon on the War:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
May she (this country) preserve her unity, and that nobly disinterested foreign
policy manifested, to the admiration of all Europe (indeed!!) in Cuba and Mexico:
so that, when the vials of apocalyptic wrath beyond the seas are spent, she may enter
to motion peace—the welcome arbitress of Europe’s dissensions, the trusted daughter,
first of England, but in lesser degree of all the nations now at strife, called in to
cover their shame and to mediate the purgation of their sins.

<p class="book">
<em>Poems, by Maurice Maeterlinck.</em> [<em>Dodd, Mead and Company, New York.</em>]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The publisher of Maeterlinck’s <em>Poems</em> states apologetically that there
has been a demand for a complete edition of the Belgian’s works, hence his
justification in publishing a translation of the poems that originally appeared
twenty years ago. The service rendered thereby to the author is of doubtful
value: great writers are inclined to forget their youthful follies; as far as
the English reading public is concerned the little book may be of some interest
as a pale suggestion of an early stage in the development of Maeterlinck’s
talent. I say a pale suggestion, for with all the conscientious labor
of the translator the poems Anglicised have lost their chief, if not sole value—their
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
Verlainean musicalness. If as a verslibrist Maeterlinck was obviously
influenced by Whitman, his rhymed verses bear the unmistakable
stamp of the poet who preached: “De la musique avant toute chose....
De la musique encore et toujours!” Back in the eighties Maeterlinck belonged
to the Belgian group of Symbolists, who, like Elskamp, Rodenbach,
van <a id="corr-29"></a>Lerberghe, Verhaeren, reflected the French school which began with
Baudelaire and culminated through Rimbaud and Verlaine in Mallarmé.
Yet, unlike his great friend, Verhaeren, the Mystic of Silence directed his
genius into a different channel and abandoned verse as a medium of expression.
In the collected poems, the <em>Serres Chaudes</em> and the <em>Chansons</em>,
despite the mentioned influences, we discover the Maeterlinckian key-note—the
languor of the oppressed soul, helplessly inactive in “a hot-house whose
doors are closed forever.” We are dazzled frequently with such beautiful
lines as “O blue monotony of my heart!”; “Green as the sea temptations
creep”; “the purple snakes of dream”; “O nights within my humid soul”;
“My hands, the lilies of my soul, Mine eyes, the heavens of my heart.” A
friend confessed to me that these <a id="corr-30"></a>similes reminded him of Bodenheim; to
be sure, this compliment should be laid at the door of the translator.

“<span class="smallcaps">The Great American Novel.</span>”
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Harbor, by Ernest Poole.</em> [<em>The Macmillan Company, New York.</em>]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
In America today, other things being equal, that novelist first achieves
success who writes—let us say—of the social fabric, rather than of the
eternal verities. Thus, in the case of two undoubtedly great artists, John
Galsworthy and Joseph Conrad, the former had to wait but half the latter’s
time before he came to enjoy real popularity.
</p>

<p>
And so it is not difficult to understand the noteworthy and deserved
success of <em>The Harbor</em>—a book so good that one would be inclined to wonder
if it <em>could become popular</em>. Mr. Poole writes with charm and a passionate
earnestness of the growth through young manhood of his hero. He knows
the New York water-front well and it furnishes an original and interesting
background. The boy goes through college, to Europe for a happy year or
two and returns to become a successful magazine writer—a worshipper at
the shrine of “big” men. Gradually his social conscience is awakened and
his entire life is transformed—his allegiance is transferred from the presidents
of the corporations who own the steamers to the striking stokers and
their fellows. On the whole the picture is impressively convincing and
Mr. Poole has caught in his pages much of the most glowing thought of
idealistic youth.
</p>

<p>
His work is so very good that criticism may appear ungracious—still,
if one may be allowed: some of the young men at college speak Mr. Poole’s
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
thoughts and not their own. College men do not think as Mr. Poole would
have you believe they do—at least not until a year or two after they have
graduated. And isn’t Eleanore, the hero’s wife, just a little too perfect—even
for the role she has to play? How well an amiable weakness would
become her! Finally, <em>The Harbor</em> has the commonest fault of almost all
first novels that have for their subject the social fabric: there is too much
thought (or too little action)—the author wants to give his opinion on all
the things he has ever seriously thought about.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Poole has tempered his fine seriousness with just a little more
of the creative artist’s austerity he will produce a greater novel than <em>The
Harbor</em>, and one that will fulfill the splendid promise of this first book.

<em>Children of Earth: A Play of New England, by Alice Brown.</em>
[<em>The Macmillan Company, New York.</em>]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Frankly, I do not like the spectacle of a collection of New Englanders,
well past middle age, splashing about in a puddle of sex. And that is what
<em>Children of Earth</em> is. Of course sex is interesting—most of the time;
New Englanders are interesting sometimes (especially when as skilfully
drawn as Miss Brown draws them); but the combination is rather too much.
</p>

<p>
In the first place what happens to these people of Miss Brown’s play
never seems of any real importance—it isn’t simply that they are unsympathetic.
Nor need one believe for a moment in the old idea that in true
tragedy the great must suffer. But at least either the great or the typical
must, and I cannot feel that these children of earth are either. The play
is well enough done; it may be compounded of fact; but I doubt if it exhibits
that finer thing by far—truth. How much better work might Winthrop
Ames’ money have purchased.

<em>American Thought, by Woodbridge Riley.</em>

<p class="noindent">
A historical analysis of American philosophical theories, from Puritanism
to New Realism, through the stages of Idealism, Deism, Materialism,
Realism, Transcendentalism, Evolutionism, and Pragmatism. The work
lacks the strict impartiality of a text-book, which it evidently intends to be.
The author reveals a tendency to prove that American thought has developed
independently of European influences; this appears to be true to a certain
extent in regard to Pragmatism, as the philosophy of practicality.

<span class="smallcaps">The Poetry of A. E.</span>
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Collected Poems, by A. E.</em> [<em>The Macmillan Company, New York.</em>]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A friend of mine once expressed pained surprise on hearing that A. E.
was among the poets I delighted to read. Having just heard me dissent
from occultism, he could not understand how one who did not believe in
theosophy, esoteric Buddhism, or any of the many modern forms of Mumbo-jumboism
could possibly take delight in a poet who, according to him, was
a theosophist, or revere poems which had first appeared in a theosophical
journal.
</p>

<p>
Poetry, however, is not a record of one’s beliefs; it is a record of one’s
experiences; and while the existence of God may be asserted and just as
easily disproved, in the medium of rhyming language, there is no question
of poetry involved. But it is equally true that when a poet describes a spiritual
experience, though he may draw his images from Neo-Platonic philosophy,
Christian tradition or even the animatism of the primitive poets, there
is no question of theological belief implied.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, we open Mr. Russell’s book at random, as I actually
did when this volume reached me, and come across the following lines, we
must be blind to a wide-spread experience of mankind if we cannot see that
it expresses poetic truth as well as poetic beauty:

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
But Mr. Russell’s mysticism—and mysticism, being an attitude rather
than an intellectual belief, is something that is legitimately expressible in
poetry, and is moreover something that Mr. Russell constantly and beautifully
expresses—is no mere world-flight. Even the Beatific Vision he would
only accept on terms becoming a man whose life is implicated in humanity.
Hence, under the title of <em>Love</em> we find him singing:

One of Mr. Russell’s poems suggests in its very first line a lyric from
Shelley’s <em>Hellas</em>, and the two poems form an interesting contrast between
the temperaments of the poet of sentimental Platonism and this later singer

While in few or none of these poems is mystic thought absent it is

The same sturdy sense of actual values that leads Mr. Russell to write
prose works on co-operation and nationality, seeing in these matters no
less than in religious ecstasy the ground for the free life of man, is evident
in the poem <em>On Behalf of Some Irishmen not Followers of Tradition</em>. But
lest sturdy commonsense be thought a grotesque piece of praise for a poem,
let me add that it is a commonsense illuminated by the purest idealism. How
close to earth this idealism moves is shown in the little sketch <em>In Connemara</em>
describing the peasant girl:

William Morris somewhere speaks of the cultured man as one who is
in sympathy with past and present and future—a contrast indeed to much
latter-day doctrine—and one is reminded of the phrase by this poet who
with such lyrical skill not only embodies all three for us, but knits them
together in that unity which alone can bestow on man the values of life which
are timeless.

</div>

<p class="from">
<em>A Chicago Reader</em>:
</p>

<p>
I don’t like what <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> or any one else I have read says about
Sanine. Too analytic, too professional.... Whatever all the worthies say about
the book being dangerous, it will not affect any soul a jot if he is not already afflicted.
</p>

<p>
What I can say is very inferior critically—only a hurried resume of images after
I had finished:
</p>

<p>
A garden like a dull green cloud descended to earth, twilight skies with supple
moving figures, gardens kaleidoscopic, hills covered with woods, odors of leaves and
grasses, a dark abandoned slimy wolf cavern of counterfeiters, dew-laden grass, shadows,
dusk, whispers, eyes in the gloom, skies pale green with faint silver stars and dark
birds, night fluttering bats, gardens filled with the melody of nightingales, a little
dying frog, lush river banks with wet reeds bending, mysterious wood nymph smiles,
mystic rays of sunlight illuminating frail flowers, crimson morning-starred heavens,
woods and streams with lithe shining bodies of humans transformed into nymphs and
satyrs—a storm that almost breathes of the one in the Pastoral Symphony and Sanine
in a flash of lightning is revealed apostrophizing it.
</p>

<p>
It hurts and one shrinks into one’s skeleton to think that perhaps a setting is
obviously made in order to be to the spirit of voluptuous indulgence. But that feeling
goes, because it is the objective thing after all—the colors and odors and atmosphere
remain.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="THREEWOMEN">
<span class="smallcaps">Three Women</span>
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>F. Guy Davis, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
There is one kind of worker active in the life of today whose work is not often
regarded in the light of art. There is a good reason for this in the fact that the work
they are attempting is so vast and vague in character that many people do not even
know it is being undertaken. They cannot understand effort on such a scale that the
final completed work, if it is ever to be completed, will be nothing less than a new
social order, a new conception of social values, actualizing itself in the shape of finer
cities and grander and braver citizens on a world scale.
</p>

<p>
There are various groups of men and women in this work of reconstruction, some
compactly organized, others not, some more militant in their attitude and some less
so, but all tending in the same direction toward a better, freer, and fuller social life.
This movement is confused and uncertain as far as a definite structural goal is concerned
because of the contradictory and sometimes seemingly antagonistic elements
that go to make it up. Some of the groups have specific architectural plans which
they defend with the artist’s passion against all other plans, or against no plan; but
the movement as a whole is pragmatic and makes its plans as it goes along, and
whatever may be the outcome the aim is at a better world, a world of beauty and
goodness in the deepest meaning of those terms.
</p>

<p>
If the modern feminists understood great women, which they do not often do,
they would contend that there is a great significance in the fact that three women
stand out prominently in this movement and in a measure at least are representative
of three groups which more or less dominate the whole. Listing them according to
age,—for on any other basis comparisons are difficult, each being effective in her own
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
sphere,—Mother Jones, Emma Goldman, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn are social artists,
working in different directions, yet in the same direction, now seeming to exclude
each other entirely, and now, no doubt, sustaining each other in spirit across the
separating gaps in the common purpose, just as old age, middle age, and youth do
sometimes in life, or just as three mountains may have separate and distinct characters
and yet be a part of the same range.
</p>

<p>
Old Mother Jones is a “character.” In her eighty-two years she has seen life’s
storm, has lived its hope, fear, love, and hate, and has mastered it. She will die
happy with the knowledge that she did her part in the fight for better things, which
she may not see but which she believes are coming.
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman is at the height of her creative effort, breaking down the stone
walls of prejudice and superstition, freeing minds from the grip of the past, preparing
the soil for new harvests of life and beauty. She sees mankind on the rack in
the agony of a herculean struggle. Giant social forces jostle each other in their
efforts for recognition in her consciousness. Her attitude toward the revolutionary
movement reminds one of the picture of the Earth in <a id="corr-32"></a>Meredith’s poem <em>Earth and
Man</em>—“Her fingers dint the breast which is his well of strength, his home of rest.”
She senses the stirring of new life in the race’s womb and she fears a bit, for she
sees clearly the possibilities of a tragic miscarriage or a premature birth.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn is the young Diana of the labor movement. Strong, full
of hope, past the fear which accompanies all beginnings, facing the future with the
courage and confidence of a youth fully launched on its career and enjoying the
sense of growing understanding and power.
</p>

<p>
The redeemers of life are those in whose natures this spirit of the creator lives,
whether it expresses itself in the labor movement or in the studio; and there is a
significance in the fact that all three of these leaders come from one class, the
workers. The interest in the movement is not by any means confined to the laboring
classes, so-called, but the real dynamic power back of the movement, the steam which
drives it on, does come from this class; and it is more than a coincidence that these
three women should all belong to it, for the vital power, the staying quality which
is the condition of real leadership, seems to have been nearly cornered by the laboring
elements.
</p>

<p>
Mother Jones has broad organizational affiliations. The great massive groups
which go to make up the American Federation of Labor are with her, generally
speaking, and lend her moral support and financial aid. Her own age and the splendid
organization of her mentality are in keeping with the corresponding qualities in the
A. F. of L.
</p>

<p>
Emma Goldman stands alone as far as organizations are concerned, like so many
great artists in other fields, always an isolated figure of heroic beauty, always the
creator, lifting the world in spite of itself.
</p>

<p>
Miss Flynn is a part of the Industrial Workers of the World, that body of roughneck
rebels which carries such promising seeds in its revolutionary young heart. Her
youth and promise symbolize the possibilities of the I. W. W.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the idea of the social artist. What splendid compensations there
must be in their work! To feel that they are part of an historic movement for a
new world of beauty and harmony, such as the utopians have dreamed of through
all history from Plato to Bellamy and Howells, a work which accelerates its speed
and power as it draws more and more to its ranks the idealists of all countries and
all classes. Is it not better for them that they know they will probably not see its
completion, that it may take centuries? They will never be disillusioned as long as
they hold to the inner faith. “To travel hopefully is better than to arrive”—and here
surely is a journey, the end of which will not be reached tomorrow. As to the
ultimate outcome, why doubt it? The race has millions of years ahead of it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a>
On the personal side each one of the
three has her own unique charm. Mother
Jones is a mother indeed. Her attitude
toward “her boys” is more than motherly;
it is grand-motherly. The sweetness and
childishness of age, however, a sort of a
sunset glow of real warmth and virility
radiates from her. She enjoys the privileges
of age, and they are many to those
who know how to accept them gracefully
as she does. Miss Flynn enjoys the privileges
of youth, which she likewise accepts
with a poise and an ease all her own.
Emma Goldman has neither the privileges
of youth nor those of age. She is at that
point in her development when in the nature
of life she must meet the challenge
of the outer world alone, when “the soul
is on the waters and must sink or swim
of its own strength.” And yet, no doubt
because of this very fact, she craves companionship
with a passion that sometimes
has a quality of blue flame. Middle age
has few privileges and many responsibilities.
Life is fair, however, to the normal
individual. It pays in advance to youth
and afterward as well to age, but it demands
service of those who are in their
prime.
</p>

<p>
To understand these personalities and
others of their kind is to understand much
of life, possibly as much as the individual
consciousness in its present form can ever
understand. To know of their struggles
is to feel that one knows history in the
making. It is not necessary to endorse,
but to fail to catch the spirit of their
work is to be unprepared for the possible
changes which seem to be more or less
imminent in the social and industrial U. S.
A. as in the world at large.

Leakless Inner Tubes

<p class="h2 u adh">
Goodyear Laminated Tubes<br />
Built Layer on Layer—Extra Thick
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
Here is something every motorist<br />
should know.
</p>

<p>
Goodyear Laminated Tubes are
built of many thin layers—each of
pure rubber—vulcanized together.
No flaw can be hidden as in a thick
piece of rubber. It is seen and
eliminated. Every layer is perfect.
</p>

<p>
Such a Tube can’t leak. And
our valve patch can’t leak, because it
is part of the Tube and not stuck on.
</p>

<p>
Remember that. Many a tire
trouble is due to leaky Tubes.
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
14% Heavier
</p>

<p>
Goodyear Laminated Tubes are
extra heavy. They
have always outworn
any tire. But this
year we have added
14 per cent to their
average thickness—all
pure rubber.
</p>

<p>
And our Tube prices this year are
reduced 20 per cent. So these layer
tubes, extra-thick, now cost about the
same as others.
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
Always Gray
</p>

<p>
Goodyear Laminated Tubes are
not colored. They are gray—the
natural pure rubber color. Color
requires a large percentage of mineral
adulteration. And minerals
hold heat, a Tube’s worst enemy.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Whatever tires you use, get Goodyear
Tubes. They will outlast your
tires, save you leaks and trouble.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
